1,"The document is a sample exam paper for the Master of Technology in Artificial Intelligent Systems program at the National University of Singapore Institute of Systems Science. The exam focuses on Intelligent Sensing Systems and includes questions on topics such as machine learning, computer vision, and sensor fusion. The exam is designed to test students' understanding and application of these concepts in the context of intelligent sensing systems."
2,"The document describes the use of intelligent sensing technology in community clubs in Singapore to promote public safety and healthy living. One of the precautionary measures implemented by a specific community club is to avoid overcrowding in the reception waiting area. The document then presents a scenario where the reader is asked to develop an intelligent sensing system to achieve two objectives: real-time human counting and a ""cough index"" to measure respiratory risks. The system must use the equipment provided in Figure 1, including a thermal camera, microphone array, and neural computing engine, and must protect privacy by not using an RGB camera. The proposed solution should include a system architecture for data acquisition and analytics, as well as vision and audio analytics methods to achieve the two objectives."
3,"The Master of Technology in Intelligent Systems program involves developing a portable stereo vision system to measure the distance between people in queues to ensure safe distancing. The system consists of two calibrated cameras with a focal length of 20cm and a baseline of 10cm. The maximum distance it can measure is evaluated using the pixel size and resolution of the images. To monitor a larger space, a camera vendor suggests purchasing a product with a larger baseline distance. The document also discusses developing an intelligent vision system for a table-cleaning robot to recognize different surface materials and litter. A hand-crafted feature extraction method is proposed to extract and represent features for the recognition process."
4,"The Master of Technology in Intelligent Systems program focuses on developing intelligent systems for various applications. One project involves creating a human action recognition system for a community club's sports hall, using CCTV footage of four categories of exercises. Two models, a 3DCNN and a Motion-2DCNN, are compared in terms of complexity, output shapes, and trainable model parameters. The 3DCNN uses raw frames as input, while the Motion-2DCNN applies optical flow to calculate motion amplitude maps. The 3DCNN has a 3D convolution layer, while the Motion-2DCNN has a 2D convolution layer. Both models have a dense output layer with 4 nodes to recognize the 4 categories of actions."
5,"The Master of Technology in Intelligent Systems program focuses on developing intelligent sensing systems, and one potential project involves creating a system to manage and enhance hawker centres in Singapore. This system would have four key features: a centralized video surveillance system for facility management, a culinary assistant system using wearable smart glasses, a tray return system to maintain cleanliness, and an interactive self-service kiosk for customer inquiries. This project is relevant as hawker centres are a unique and important part of Singaporean culture and require modernization and improvement to continue being enjoyable places for community bonding and dining."
6,"The Master of Technology in Intelligent Systems program requires students to design a centralized video surveillance system for efficient facility management. The system must meet three requirements: providing an overlapping index to optimize camera coverage, a real-time crowd index to count unique humans, and a real-time seat availability index. Computer vision methods must be applied to achieve these requirements. Additionally, a culinary assistant system using wearable smart glasses with a built-in camera is proposed to enhance the culinary skills of young hawkers. Image feature extraction methods are needed to recognize different types of dough and different stages in the cooking pan. The size of the dough cannot be used to distinguish dough types."
7,"The Master of Technology in Intelligent Systems program focuses on intelligent sensing systems, with a particular application in self-service kiosks for diners. To avoid physical touch, speech recognition is used, but the use of face masks in the ""New Normal"" may affect speech intelligibility. Figure 10 shows that there are small differences in frequency response and significant decreases in intensity at higher frequencies when wearing a mask. The program has collected voice data without a mask and extracted spectrogram features (Figure 11) to build the speech recognition system. The question is whether the use of face masks will affect the analyzed voice features shown in Figure 10."
8,"The Master of Technology in Intelligent Systems program focuses on using advanced technology to improve systems and processes. One example is a self-service kiosk that helps diners choose a food stall by comparing a photo they provide to a database of reference photos. The system uses SIFT features to determine the similarity between the query photo and reference photos. Table 4 shows the pairwise feature similarities between two images, and by analyzing this data, the most matched photo can be identified from the reference database. Figure 12 shows an example of a query photo and reference photo used for this food stall enquiry, with keypoints highlighted in white."
9,"The Master of Technology in Intelligent Systems program includes a case study about an automated tray-clearing system in a hawker centre. Customers are charged an extra $1 if they use a tray, which is refunded when the tray is returned at a designated point. Initially, the system used RFID to detect returned trays, but this was not effective as some diners were only returning the trays and leaving behind their bowls and plates. To improve accuracy, a webcam was added to verify the presence of a valid tray. However, the system still had some failures, as shown in Table 5. One possible cause for this is the speed at which the system detects valid trays (1 frame/second). A solution to this issue could be to increase the"
