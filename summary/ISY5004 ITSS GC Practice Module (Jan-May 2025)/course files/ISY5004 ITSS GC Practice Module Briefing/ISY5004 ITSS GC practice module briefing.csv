1,"The ISY5004 Intelligent Sensing Systems (ITSS) GC Practice Module is a course offered by the National University of Singapore. It is part of the AIS06 FT/PT stackable program and is taught by Dr. Tian Jing. The module focuses on the development and application of intelligent sensing systems, covering topics such as sensor technologies, data processing, and system integration. Students will gain hands-on experience through projects and case studies, and will develop skills in problem-solving, teamwork, and communication."
2,"The Intelligent Sensing Systems (ITSS) practice module is designed to provide students with hands-on experience in developing and implementing intelligent sensing systems. The module covers topics such as data acquisition, signal processing, machine learning, and system integration. It also includes a project component where students will work in teams to design and develop a real-world intelligent sensing system. The module is open to students from various disciplines and aims to equip them with the necessary skills for a career in the field of intelligent sensing systems.

3,The ISY5004 ITSS GC practice module briefing outlines that the GC only has 10 credit units and is focused on Intelligent Sensing Systems. It is owned by the National University of Singapore and all rights are reserved.
4,"The S-ITSS/Practice module for ISY5004 has a team size limit of 5 members and participants must form their teams in ""Practice Project Groups"" on Canvas. Teams can choose their own project ideas or source projects from sponsor companies. The project scope must demonstrate the advantages of intelligent sensing techniques using skills taught in the certificate. Examples of suitable project scopes include image and video analytics, audio and speech analytics, and sensory data analytics. However, projects involving NLP or app development are not suitable. The project scope will be evaluated on a case by case basis."
5,"The assessment for the S-ITSS/Practice module includes a proposal/progress presentation worth 5%, a final report worth 15%, a final recorded 15-minute presentation worth 15%, a final developed system worth 25%, and a peer assessment worth 5%. The final written exam for the entire Graduate Certificate is worth 50%. All rights reserved by the National University of Singapore."
6,"The schedule and deadlines for the S-ITSS/Practice module are outlined on page 6 of the document 'ISY5004 ITSS GC practice module briefing.pdf'. The briefing is for both full-time and part-time students, as well as those taking the stackable option. The module will begin on 6 Jan. 2025 and end on 11 Jan. 2025. The proposal/progress presentation will take place on 7 Feb. 2024 and 8 April, 2024, via zoom. The written exam will be held in mid May, 2025, and the final project deliverables must be submitted by 11:59 PM on the last day of the exam week."
7,"The document outlines the submission requirements for the S-ITSS/Practice module. The proposal/progress presentation must use the provided template and be uploaded before the presentation day. The final submission must include source code, dataset, and an 8-10 page report using the provided template. A recommended collaborative writing tool is also suggested. All files must be zipped into a single file and submitted as a team. A single final report pdf file and a recorded presentation video (15 minutes) must also be submitted. There will be no in-person presentations, and the recorded presentation will be marked for evaluation."
8,"The document provides examples of past ITSS practice projects, including a vision system for recognizing and correcting physical exercises, emotion recognition using voice and body posture, facial attendance with anti-spoofing protection, crowd surveillance, hand washing steps recognition, air drawing with hand posture recognition, lip reading, audio-visual intelligent infant activities tracking, tennis sports video analytics, automatic werewolf referee system using computer vision, SNAP-IT-FIND-IT image retrieval application, paper plane folding guidance, real-time computer interface control with human pose estimation, and vision-based operator activity recognition for personnel efficiency analysis. These projects were developed for various industries including healthcare, consumer electronics, and manufacturing."
9,"This FAQ page answers questions about the graduate certificate program, including the possibility of failing, project requirements, use of public datasets, and final deliverables. It also clarifies that a recorded video presentation will replace an in-person presentation and outlines the requirements for the video. Additionally, it specifies that literature reviews should cover relevant works and that the experimental results section should compare the system's performance with existing systems or explore different configurations. Finally, it states that AI-generated speech cannot be used in the recorded video presentation."
