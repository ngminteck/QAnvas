1,"The document outlines the agenda for the ISY5004 Intelligent Sensing Systems (ITSS) GC course, which is divided into three modules: Vision Systems, Spatial Reasoning from Sensor Data, and Real-time Audio-Visual Sensing and Sense Making. The first module covers the foundations of computer vision and using deep learning for building vision systems. The second module focuses on spatial sensing, reasoning, and recognition. The third module covers the foundations of video and audio analytics and using deep learning for building these systems. Each module is taught by different lecturers and includes hands-on activities such as designing a minimum viable product for vision systems. The course is designed for both full-time and part-time students."
