1,"The document outlines the agenda for a course on Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Systems that will take place from August 10 to September 7, 2024. The course will be taught by instructors Zhu Fangming and Gary Leung Cheung Chi. Topics covered include an introduction to pattern recognition and machine learning, neural network basics, building multi-layer perceptron neural networks, different neural network models and designs, deep neural networks and deep learning systems, and case studies on using convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The course will also include workshops for hands-on practice."
2,"The topic of this section is a series of workshops and modules on pattern recognition and machine learning systems. The workshops will be led by instructors Gary Leung Cheung Chi and Zhu Fangming, with Module 4.3 focusing on building and training ResNet. Module 4.4 will continue with ResNet and include a quiz on September 7th. Module 5.1 and 5.2 will cover ensemble and hybrid machine learning techniques, followed by workshops in Module 5.3 and 5.4, with a quiz on September 7th. All workshops will take place between August 10th and September 7th, with a generated date of August 1st at 10:18:02."
