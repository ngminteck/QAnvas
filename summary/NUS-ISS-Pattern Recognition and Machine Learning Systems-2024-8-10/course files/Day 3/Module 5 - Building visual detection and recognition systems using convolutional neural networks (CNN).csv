Page 2, The need of a deeper network and functional APIs is evident in many of the world's largest social networks . The need for a deeper and functional network is also evident in some of the network's largest networks .
Page 3, Do you think deep neural net can represent this function? Do we think deep-net can do this? Do you have a question? Please email us at http://www.prumls/y2024/v1.03
Page 4, A feedforward network with a single layer is enough to represent any function . Universal approximation theorem is a theorem for all problem? Is deep neural network the panacea for all challenges?
Page 5," If there exists such a function, then by universal approximation theorem, there should have a neural network that can represent the function ."
Page 6," If a mapping is doable by human, we should be able to get neural network to achieve the same . But, universal approximation theorem does not suggest the ways to make neural network . Certain challenges may be inherently unsolvable by any"

Page 19, Keras was created by the National University of Singapore . Keras is a form of architecture called Keras . The basic architecture of Keras has been designed by the university itself .
Page 20, Keras API is the official high-level API of Tensorflow . Keras is the preferred way of building neural network . It is possible to build deep net solely using TensorFlow but toooo many repetition .
Page 21, Keras API is the official high-level API of Tensorflow . It is better optimized for TF and is better integration with TF-specific features .
