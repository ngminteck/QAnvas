Page 5,"if human can clearly discriminate various breeds of dogs, it implies the existence of a function that can map images of dogs to classes (breeds) of dogs . by universal approximation theorem"
Page 6,"universal approximation theorem does not suggest the ways to make neural network to have the specified capabilities . certain challenges may be inherently unsolvable by any function, so neural net can't do much either ."

Page 10,a single layer net can approximate any function (proven) but the theorem does not provide any clue to achieve that . the experiences from the past decade show that depth of a net is the key to great performance
