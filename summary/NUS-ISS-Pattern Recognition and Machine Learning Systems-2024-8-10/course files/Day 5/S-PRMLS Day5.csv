1,"The document covers the fifth day of the Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Systems course, taught by Dr. Zhu Fangming from NUS-ISS. It is not to be reproduced without permission from ISS, NUS."
2,The fifth day of the S-PRMLS program focused on ensemble and hybrid machine learning techniques. These techniques involve combining multiple models to improve overall performance and accuracy. The day included a workshop where participants could practice implementing ensemble methods.
3,"The document discusses ensemble and hybrid machine learning techniques, which involve combining multiple models to improve overall performance. Ensemble methods use a combination of models to make predictions, while hybrid methods combine different types of models. These techniques can improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Some examples of ensemble and hybrid methods include bagging, boosting, and stacking. It is important to choose appropriate models and optimize their combination to achieve the best results."
4,"The document on page 4 introduces the concept of ensemble models, which combine multiple individual models to improve overall performance. It specifically covers two popular ensemble methods, Random Forest and Boosting, and also mentions the use of hybrid machine learning models. These techniques can help to reduce bias and variance in predictions and can be useful for handling complex data sets."
5,"Ensembles are made up of multiple models that each make a prediction or ""vote"" on a problem. The final prediction is determined by taking the average or majority of the votes. This approach is used for both classification and regression problems. Ensembles offer benefits such as improved accuracy, reduced overfitting, and the ability to handle complex data. It is not always necessary to use ensembles, but they can be beneficial in situations where one smart model may not be able to accurately capture the complexity of the data."
6,"The content on page 6 discusses the concept of ensemble learning, which involves combining multiple models to improve prediction accuracy. It explains the different types of ensembles, such as bagging and boosting, and the benefits of using them. It also mentions DataCamp as a resource for learning more about ensemble learning."
7,"The document discusses the motivation behind using a single model for multiple test cases. It highlights the need for a standardized approach in testing and the benefits of using a consistent model across different scenarios. The goal is to improve efficiency, accuracy, and reliability in the testing process. The document also mentions the importance of proper documentation and communication among team members to ensure the success of this approach."
8,"The presentation discusses the benefits of using an ensemble of models for prediction. It highlights the fact that adding more models with the same accuracy but different variance can improve the overall performance of the ensemble. This is because no single model can accurately predict everything, but when combined, the ensemble is more reliable and robust."
9,"A good ensemble is made up of multiple hypotheses generated by the same base learner. According to Tom Dietterich (2000), the ensemble must have both accuracy and diversity among its classifiers in order to be more accurate than any individual member. This means that the classifiers must be accurate in their predictions and also differ from each other in some way."
10,"The key point of this section is that ensembles, which combine multiple models, tend to perform better when there is a diversity among the models. One way to introduce diversity is through bagging, which involves training multiple models with different random samples. This technique can be applied to any method, but is commonly used with decision trees. Each model in the ensemble has an equal vote when making predictions."
11,"Bagging, short for ""bootstrap aggregating,"" is a method used in machine learning to improve the accuracy and stability of predictive models. It involves drawing multiple bootstrap samples (with replacement) from the training data and training models (such as neural networks or decision trees) on each sample. The algorithm involves randomly selecting 67% of the training data and training a model on this sample, repeating this process N times to get N models. The final prediction is then made by taking the un-weighted average of all the models. Bagging helps to reduce the variance of a single model and can lead to better overall performance."
12,"The document discusses the concept of bagging, or bootstrap aggregating, as a method for improving the accuracy of machine learning algorithms. It provides examples of bagging using decision trees, where multiple trees are trained on different subsets of the data and their predictions are combined to make a final prediction. Bagging has been shown to reduce variance and improve overall performance, especially for unstable models. It is a popular technique in ensemble learning and has been successfully applied in various fields such as finance and bioinformatics."
13,"The document discusses the concept of bagging, which is a technique used to improve the accuracy of regression models. It involves creating multiple models from different subsets of the training data and combining their predictions to obtain a more accurate result. An example of bagging is given, where 10 regression models are built from 10 bootstrap samples, each with 100 training data. This technique can help reduce the variance of the model and improve its predictive power."
14,"The number of bagged models required for a given data set and problem varies, but generally, less than 50 models should work well and often less than 25 is sufficient. This is illustrated by an example using the soybean data set."
15,"This section discusses the question of how many bagged models are needed for a given dataset. The number of models required depends on the size and complexity of the dataset, as well as the desired level of accuracy. Generally, more models are needed for larger and more complex datasets. However, the number of models needed can also be reduced by using feature selection techniques or by using ensemble methods such as boosting or stacking. Ultimately, the number of bagged models needed should be determined through experimentation and validation."
16,"The document discusses the reasons why prediction models work. It states that a prediction model is built to estimate a function with input variables and a variable to be predicted. The expected squared prediction error at a specific point can be decomposed into three components: Noise, Bias, and Variance. While Noise cannot be reduced by the model, Bias and Variance can be reduced by optimizing the model. Bias refers to the simplifying assumptions made by the model, while Variance refers to the sensitivity of the model to small changes in the training data. By reducing Bias and Variance, the overall model error can be reduced, leading to more accurate predictions."
17,"The document discusses the concept of model error and distinguishes between error due to bias and error due to variance. Bias refers to the difference between the model's predicted value and the actual value, while variance refers to the variability of the model's prediction for a specific data point. Both bias and variance contribute to the overall error of a model, and it is important to find a balance between the two to create an accurate and reliable model."
18,"The concept of model error is discussed in terms of bias and variance. Models with high bias do not fit the training data well, while those with low variance are not affected by small changes in the training data. An example is given of three data points (shown in red) that can be moved slightly without significantly changing the model or its predictions."
19,"The concept of model error is discussed, specifically the trade-off between bias and variance. Models that over-fit the data have low bias, meaning they fit the training data very well, but high variance, meaning that small changes in the training data can greatly affect the model and its predictions. This is demonstrated by moving three data points in a graph, shown in red, which significantly changes the model and its predictions."
20,"The concept of bias and variance in machine learning models is discussed, with a focus on finding a balance between the two. Bias refers to the difference between the predicted values and the true values, while variance refers to the sensitivity of the model to changes in the training data. A high bias model is less complex and may underfit the data, while a high variance model is more complex and may overfit the data. The goal is to find a model that minimizes both bias and variance, known as the ""sweet spot."" Techniques such as cross-validation and regularization can help in achieving this balance."
21,"The key point of this content is the tradeoff between bias and variance in machine learning models. It is important to balance these two factors for accurate predictions. This tradeoff involves choosing between high complexity models with low bias and high variance, and low complexity models with high bias and low variance. The goal is to find a smart and stable model, but it is possible to reduce variance without increasing bias and to reduce over-fitting without under-fitting."
22,"The concept of reducing variance without increasing bias is discussed in this section. Averaging models is a common technique used to reduce model variance, but for large N, the residual model error is mainly due to bias. In practice, this reduction is smaller than 1/N because models are often correlated. Additionally, the variance of models trained on fewer training cases is usually larger. It is important to note that this technique only works with certain learning methods, as very stable methods already have low variance and therefore do not benefit much from averaging."
23,"Bagging is a technique that involves training multiple base classifiers on different bootstrap samples of the data and then combining their predictions. However, this approach can potentially hurt accuracy if the data is poor, as each base classifier is trained on less data (around 67% of the total data). While bagging typically improves accuracy, there are cases where it may not have a significant impact."
24,", or parameters

The document discusses ways to create model diversity in machine learning. This can be achieved by manipulating the training data through techniques like bagging, manipulating the input features, and varying the classifier type, architecture, or parameters. These methods can help improve the performance and robustness of machine learning models by introducing diversity and reducing overfitting."
25,"Random Forests is a machine learning technique that involves creating multiple decision trees using random samples of data and features. This randomization increases model diversity and training speed, as there is less computation required at each tree split. The final prediction is made by using un-weighted voting from all the trees."
26,"Random forests are a popular machine learning algorithm that is often more effective than bagging. It is robust to noise and easy to use, with surprisingly high accuracy. However, the large number of trees used in random forests can make it difficult to interpret the results. The variance of random forest trees is higher than bagged trees, so it typically requires 10 times as many trees. The trees should generally be unpruned to encourage diversity. Random forests require hundreds to thousands of trees and have an additional parameter to tune, the probability of using a feature at each split. Unlike bagging and boosting, random forests are only suitable for decision trees."
27,"Random Forests have been successfully used in various vision tasks, including keypoint recognition, digit recognition, visual word clustering, object segmentation, organ detection, and pose estimation. Lepetit et al. (2006) used Random Forests for keypoint recognition, while Amit and Geman (1997) applied it to digit recognition. Moosmann et al. (2006) used Random Forests for visual word clustering, while Shotton et al. (2008) used it for object segmentation. Criminisi et al. (2009) used Random Forests for organ detection, and Rogez et al. (2008) applied it to pose estimation."
28,"Kinect's decision forest involves two steps: generating a 3D image using ""structured light"" technology and computing features by comparing the depth of pixels in close proximity. This process is repeated multiple times to determine if pixels belong to the same object."
29,"The document discusses the decision forest algorithm used by Kinect, a motion-sensing device, to accurately track and recognize body parts. The algorithm involves training multiple trees on pre-labeled features and using a large cluster of cores to speed up the process. The trained classifiers then assign probabilities to pixels for each body part, and the algorithm selects the areas with the highest probabilities to identify the body part type. This breakthrough in artificial intelligence allows for real-time and accurate body tracking."
30,"The document discusses testing random forests, a popular machine learning algorithm. Unlike other algorithms, random forests do not require a separate test set. Instead, they use the out-of-bag (OOB) data, which is the data left over after creating each tree in the forest. The OOB data is used to test each tree's predictions, and the majority vote of all trees' predictions is taken as the forest's prediction. This process is repeated for every training example, and the error is estimated by summing over all training examples. For regression problems, the forest prediction is computed by averaging all test predictions, and the mean squared error (MSE) is calculated."
31,"The document discusses different methods for measuring variable importance in decision trees and random forests. For a single tree, the order in which variables occur in the tree is a measure of their importance. In a random forest, the number of times a variable appears in all trees can indicate its importance, but a better method is to sum the total reduction in impurity for all nodes that test the variable. This can be seen in the example of V1, which occurs multiple times and has a higher total reduction in impurity compared to V2, which occurs less frequently."
32,"The document discusses a method for measuring variable importance in a predictive model. This method involves randomly shuffling the values of a given input variable and comparing the model accuracy before and after the shuffling. The difference is a measure of how important the variable is for predicting the response. The detailed steps include testing each tree on its own out-of-bag examples and counting the votes for the correct class, then randomly permuting the values for the input variable and retesting the tree. The importance of the variable is calculated by subtracting the average number of correct votes from the shuffled data from the total number of votes."
33,"Boosting is a machine learning technique that aims to create a strong learner from a set of weak learners. A weakly learned model is only slightly better than random guessing, while a strongly learned model is highly correlated with the truth. The essentials of boosting involve building a model without over-fitting the data, increasing the weights of training examples that the model gets wrong, and retraining the model using the weighted training set. This process is repeated multiple times to improve the overall performance of the model."
34,"The document discusses the concept of boosting, which is a machine learning technique used to improve the performance of a model by combining several weak learners into a stronger one. This is achieved by iteratively adjusting the weights of the weak learners to focus on the data points that were previously misclassified. Boosting is a popular method for improving the accuracy of decision trees and has been successfully applied in various applications, such as predicting stock prices and classifying images. DataCamp offers courses on boosting and other machine learning techniques for individuals and organizations."
35,"The basic boosting algorithm involves training a model on a set of equally weighted training samples, computing the error of the model, and then increasing the weights on the incorrectly predicted cases. This process is repeated multiple times until a final model is obtained, which is a weighted prediction of each individual model. This algorithm is typically repeated for over 100 iterations to improve the accuracy of the final model."
36,AdaBoost is a machine learning algorithm that involves training a model by re-weighting training examples and using a weighted average of weak classifiers to make predictions. The goal of the classifier is to reduce the weighted error relative to the training example weights. This algorithm was developed by Freund and Schapire in 1994.
37,"Overview


AdaBoost is a machine learning algorithm that combines weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. It works by iteratively training weak classifiers on weighted versions of the data, where the weights are adjusted based on the performance of the previous classifiers. The final classifier is a weighted combination of all the weak classifiers. AdaBoost is particularly effective for handling imbalanced data and can be applied to a variety of classification tasks."
38,"This slide from the presentation discusses the AdaBoost algorithm and its results after 1, 3, and 20 iterations. The colors represent different classifications, while the size of the circles represents the weights assigned to each classification. The source is cited as Elder, John's paper on ensemble methods."
39,"AdaBoost is a technique that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a stronger classifier. The adjusted weights in AdaBoost can be used in different algorithms, such as neural networks, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors, to improve their performance. For neural networks, the learning rate can be scaled by the weights, while for decision trees, the membership of instances is scaled. In k-nearest neighbors, the vote of each node is also scaled by the weights. This allows for better prediction accuracy and helps to overcome the limitations of individual weak classifiers."
40,"Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique that treats learning as a gradient descent optimization problem. Similar to Adaboost, models are learned and added to the ensemble sequentially. The next base-model being learned uses the predicted values of other models in the ensemble and the training data to minimize the loss function, such as mean absolute error. The gradient descent method is used to adjust the model parameters. This process continues until the average error across all training examples is minimized."
41,"The gradient boosting algorithm, introduced in 2014, has gained popularity and is widely used through the implementation of XGBoost. This algorithm combines multiple weak learners to create a strong model and is known for its high accuracy and ability to handle large datasets. It works by iteratively fitting new models to the residual errors of the previous models, resulting in a final model that minimizes the overall error. XGBoost also includes features such as regularization and parallel processing for improved performance."
42,"The document discusses the differences between boosting and bagging/random forests (RF) in machine learning. It states that in practice, bagging/RF usually improves performance, but may not work well with stable models. Boosting and RF may provide better results, with boosting often being more effective than bagging. However, boosting may not perform well on noisy datasets, while bagging/RF do not have this issue. Additionally, bagging/RF is easier to parallelize."
43,"Ensembles are a method of using multiple models to reduce variance and increase accuracy. They work best when the models have different opinions or ""variance."" This typically refers to using multiple models of the same type. Bagging and Boosting are the most commonly used methods for ensembles, with Random Forest becoming increasingly popular."
44,"Ensembles are a popular approach in machine learning that involves combining multiple models to improve predictive performance. There are various methods for creating ensembles, including injecting randomness, using different training sets, and forcing differences between models. Ensemble combining approaches include unweighted voting, weighted voting based on accuracy or heuristics, and stacking, where a combination function is learned. The ultimate goal is to reduce correlated errors between models and improve overall performance."
45,"Hybrid machine learning models combine different, heterogeneous machine learning approaches to improve the quality of reasoning and adaptivity of solutions. This is similar to ensemble models, which also use information fusion, but with multiple homogeneous weak models. Both types of models have been successfully used in various real-world problems such as person recognition, medical diagnosis, and financial forecasting."
46,"The ""Multiple Classifier Systems"" approach involves using multiple classifiers, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, to make predictions. This allows for a more diverse range of model combination methods beyond just averaging. Typically, there are a small number of experts in this approach."
47,"The document discusses multiple classifier systems and provides an example of various classifiers such as nearest neighbor, Gaussian quadratic, naive Bayes, multilayer neural network, support vector machine, and simple perceptron. Each classifier has its own strengths and weaknesses, and combining them can improve overall performance and accuracy. This approach is known as ensemble learning and has been shown to be effective in various applications."
48,"The multiple classifier system, also known as stacking, involves training a learning algorithm to combine the predictions of several other learning algorithms. This can be done through an arbitrator solution, where individual classifiers make predictions and the final decision is made through a majority vote, weighted decision, or selection of the best expert. This approach can be applied to various types of learning algorithms, such as rule-based systems, SVM, neural nets, and logistic regression. Stacking can improve the overall performance and accuracy of the system."
49,"The example of an airfare price prediction demonstrates the use of multiple classifier systems, where different classifiers with the same skills are combined to make more accurate predictions. In this case, the classifiers are experts with the decision-making skills of either buying or waiting. The arbitrator helps determine which classifier to use in different situations. The example shows the use of a time series forecast and a rule-based classifier, as well as a neural network forecast, to make the final decision of whether to buy or wait for a specific route, airline, and time to takeoff."
50,"The concept of self-tuning systems involves using one technique to tune or learn the architecture for another, such as using a neural network to learn a fuzzy system or using a genetic algorithm to optimize a neural network. This approach can be applied to various components of a system, including adjusting population size, crossover and mutation rates during a genetic algorithm search, learning and tuning rules and rule weights, and controlling learning rates and soft thresholds in rules. Other strategies, such as feature selection and data reduction, can also be used to improve the efficiency of self-tuning systems."
51,"(defuzzification)

The document discusses self-tuning systems, specifically the example of neuro-fuzzy systems. These systems use neural networks to represent and learn a fuzzy system. Nodes in the network represent rule inputs, conditions, and actions. A special training algorithm is required to input rules and determine the system output. The example shows how the system uses the strongest connection to each condition element to generate rules. The document also mentions other schemes for generating rules and explains the components involved in the process, such as fuzzification and defuzzification."
52,"The self-tuning system example of GA-ML involves using genetic algorithms to learn rules for predicting the type of object based on input variables. In this example, the input variables are F1 and F2, which represent size and shape respectively, while the output variable is Class, which can take on the values of either widgets or gadgets. The chromosome [REDACTED_PHONE] represents the rule that if F1 is small or medium and F2 is a tube, then the object is classified as a widget."
53,"The example of a self-tuning system, GA-Neural, uses genetic algorithms (GAs) to generate and tune neural networks (NNs). The GA chromosome represents the NN topology, including the number of hidden layers, hidden nodes, and links/weights. This approach has the advantage of avoiding local minima more than back-propagation, but the size of the chromosome can become too large if the topology is being learned."
54,"The document discusses a self-tuning system example, GA-Neural, developed by LG Electric. This system uses a neural network (NN) to control an air conditioning unit and a genetic algorithm (GA) to adjust the number of neurons and weights in the NN. The system takes into account various factors such as room temperature, outdoor temperature, time, and user preferences to determine the desired temperature. This allows the air-con to adapt to the user's preferences and create a more comfortable environment."
55,"The concept of co-operating experts involves using different techniques together to create a single solution. For example, a neural network may provide input to a fuzzy system, which then produces a solution for a user based on sensor inputs. This approach allows for a more robust and comprehensive solution to be developed."
56,"The example given in this section demonstrates the use of co-operating experts, specifically a fuzzy system and a neural network, in controlling the temperature of liquid waste and air in a pulp factory's recovery boiler. The shape of the pile in the boiler is important for the efficiency of the recovery process, and the neural network recognizes the shape from an edge image and passes the information to the fuzzy system. This allows for precise control of the air and heat in the boiler, resulting in the recovery of expensive chemicals from the liquid waste. A CCD camera and sensor data are used for image processing, and a PID controller is used for air and heat control."
57,"Bagging and boosting are two popular ensemble learning techniques used in machine learning. Bagging, short for ""bootstrap aggregating"", involves creating multiple models using different subsets of the training data and then combining their predictions to make a final prediction. This helps to reduce the variance and improve the overall accuracy of the model. Boosting, on the other hand, involves iteratively training weak models and giving more weight to misclassified data in each iteration, resulting in a strong final model. The R programming language and the Rattle package provide easy-to-use tools for implementing bagging and boosting techniques."

59,"The document discusses building ensembles in SPSS Modeler, which is a statistical software used for data analysis and predictive modeling. Ensembles are a collection of models that work together to make more accurate predictions. The process of building ensembles involves selecting and combining different models, such as decision trees, neural networks, and regression models, to create a more robust and accurate model. This can be done through techniques such as bagging, boosting, and stacking. Ensembles can improve the overall performance of a model and reduce the risk of overfitting. SPSS Modeler provides various tools and techniques to easily build ensembles and evaluate their performance."
60,"The document discusses the use of the Scikit-Learn library to implement a Random Forest classifier. The code snippet provided shows how to split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function. Then, the RandomForestClassifier model is imported and used to fit the training data. The predictions are made on the test data and the results are evaluated using the confusion_matrix, classification_report, and accuracy_score functions. The final output provides the confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score of the model."
61,"This section discusses AdaBoosting, a popular ensemble learning technique, and how to implement it using the Scikit-Learn library. The code for importing necessary packages, loading data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and fitting an AdaBoostClassifier model with 50 estimators and a learning rate of 1 is provided. The model is then used to make predictions on the test data."
62,"The document discusses the use of deep neural network ensembles for time series classification. It provides an example of a GitHub repository that contains code for implementing this technique, specifically for the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks 2019. The code includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. The document also mentions the use of transfer learning and discusses the potential benefits and challenges of using deep neural network ensembles for time series classification tasks."
63,"The presentation discusses three application examples of using ensembled neural networks in different fields: vehicle classification, pooled flood frequency analysis, and ConvNets. Ensembling, or combining multiple neural networks, has been shown to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. In the vehicle classification example, ensembling was used to accurately classify different types of vehicles in traffic. In the pooled flood frequency analysis, ensembling was used to predict flood frequency in different locations. The third example demonstrates how ensembling can be implemented using Keras, a popular deep learning library. Overall, ensembling has proven to be a useful technique in improving the performance of neural networks in various applications."
64,"The Ensemble Workshop is a training session that focuses on using ensemble techniques in machine learning. It covers topics such as stacking, bagging, and boosting, and how to implement them in Python. The workshop also includes hands-on exercises and examples to help participants understand and apply these techniques effectively. It is designed for those with a basic understanding of machine learning and programming."
65,"The document introduces the concepts of Random Forest and Boosting, two popular ensemble methods used in machine learning. It provides jupyter notebooks for each method and suggests running through them to gain a better understanding of their implementation. It also encourages experimentation with different parameter settings to compare the performance of these models."
66,"The document discusses two types of neural network (NN) ensembles - averaging and stacking. Jupyter notebooks are provided for each type, and it is important to understand how they are implemented. The performance of these models can be compared and different parameter settings can be experimented with. The StackingNNEnsemble notebook with cell output should be saved and uploaded to Canvas."
