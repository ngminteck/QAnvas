12,", now in many areas

The presentation discusses the advantages of deep learning over manually designed features. Manually designed features are often over-specified, incomplete, and time-consuming to design and validate. In contrast, learned features are adaptable, fast to learn, and can be used for both unsupervised and supervised learning. Deep learning offers a flexible and learnable framework for representing information and has shown to outperform other machine learning techniques in various fields such as speech, vision, and natural language processing. This is due to its ability to utilize large amounts of training data and its effective end-to-end joint system learning."
13,"methods have greatly advanced NLP

The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has seen significant advancements in recent years, particularly in areas such as Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis, Dialogue Agents, Question Answering, and Text Classification. These advancements have been made possible through the use of deep learning methods, which allow for the utilization of different levels of representation, including words and characters, syntax and semantics."
