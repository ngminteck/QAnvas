Page 2," Rotifer is a type of zooplankton, which is the first feed for fish larvae and a crucial part in large-scale fish hatchery production . It is a laborious task to grow and sustain a rotifer culture"
Page 3, Artificial Intelligence in the Food Industry — Using AI to Enhance Singapore’s Food Security . Checking the health of rotifer culture is a tedious process that requires well-trained staff .

Page 5, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to replace manually counting the rotifers in a water sample . DSAID Govt. decided to experiment with object-detection AI models to see if they could identify and count the different
Page 6, The AI model is trained to identify the 6 different types of rotifers which fall under healthy and unhealthy classes . The figure below shows the object detection pipeline for the rotifer counting use case .
Page 7, A single rotifer object only takes up 0.0225% of the area in an image . Data collection is done simply by taking pictures of the water samples in a petri dish using smartphone models .
Page 8, Data annotation is a crucial process that requires accurate labelling as it affects the outcome of the AI model training . It takes about 40 minutes to label each image and there are 6 different classes to annotate within each image . SFA assisted
Page 9," When we reviewed the data distribution, we realized that two-egg carriers do not contribute significantly to the training data . Ciliates, Dead and Clumps only represent only 6% of the total counts ."

Page 12, We prepared 47 training images with 10% of each type of objects assigned to the validation dataset and another 10% to the testing dataset . The objects allocation for each of the sets can be seen in the following table .
Page 13," With the training data, we trained a YOLOv3 detector and the detector wasbenchmarked on the test set . The table below shows the test results . The AI model does well in detecting and identifying healthy rotifer, healthy"
Page 14, Artificial Intelligence in the Food Industry — Using AI to Enhance Singapore’s Food Security . SFA approved the AI model for their internal use as the model can identify healthy rotifers and one-egg carriers well .

Page 16, The use-case was particularly challenging as the objects of interest were minute in size . We had to manage the expectations of our stakeholders so that they can understand the limitations of an AI model while at the same time assuring them of the
