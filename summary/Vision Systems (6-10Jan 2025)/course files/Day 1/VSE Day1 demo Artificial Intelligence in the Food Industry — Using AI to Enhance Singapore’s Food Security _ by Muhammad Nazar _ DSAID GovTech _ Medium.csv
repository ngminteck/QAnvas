7,"The article discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the food industry to enhance Singapore's food security. It mentions the importance of identifying different types of rotifers, which are microscopic organisms found in water, and how AI can help with this task. The data collection process involves taking pictures of water samples using smartphones, and the images are captured under good lighting and high resolution. The challenge lies in detecting the tiny rotifer objects, which only take up 0.0225% of the image area."
8,"The article discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance Singapore's food security. One important aspect of this is data annotation, which involves accurately labeling images to train the AI model. This process was carried out by officers from the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) who have the necessary domain knowledge. It takes approximately 40 minutes to label each image, with at least 100 rotifer objects in each image. SFA assisted with the annotation of all training and test images."
9,"The article discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the food industry to enhance Singapore's food security. It specifically focuses on a project that uses AI to identify and classify different types of rotifers in water samples. The data distribution showed that two-egg carriers were not significant and were excluded from the dataset. The remaining classes were augmented with noise and adjustments to improve image quality. The distribution of the five classes showed that ciliates, dead objects, and clumps only make up 6% of the total counts."
10,"The article discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the food industry to enhance Singapore's food security. It mentions the challenges of data imbalance in training a rotifer detection model and the attempt to address it through data augmentation. However, this approach was found to affect the quality and accuracy of the model. The focus was then shifted to training a model to detect and count rotifers and one-egg carriers, which are not the minority class. The article also mentions the use of AI to automate data preprocessing, specifically in minimizing background noise in images."
