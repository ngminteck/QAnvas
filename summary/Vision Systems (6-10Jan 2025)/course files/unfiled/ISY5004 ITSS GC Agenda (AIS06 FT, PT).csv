1,"The document outlines the agenda for the ISY5004 Intelligent Sensing Systems (ITSS) GC course, which covers three main topics: Vision Systems, Spatial Reasoning from Sensor Data, and Real-time Audio-Visual Sensing and Sense Making. The course will be taught by Tian Jing, Scott Si, Xavier Xie, and Gary Leung. The first course, Vision Systems, will cover the foundations of computer vision and building vision systems using deep learning. The second course, Spatial Reasoning from Sensor Data, will focus on 3D scene modeling, vision-based localization, and point cloud recognition. The third course, Real-time Audio-Visual Sensing and Sense Making, will cover video analytics and building systems using deep learning, as"
