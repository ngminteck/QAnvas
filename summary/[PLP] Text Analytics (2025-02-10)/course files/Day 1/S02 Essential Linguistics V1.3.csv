1,"The document introduces the Text Analytics Module 2, which focuses on essential linguistics. It is taught by Dr. Fan Zhenzhen from the National University of Singapore's Institute of Systems Science. The module covers key concepts in linguistics such as phonetics, morphology, syntax, and semantics, and how they relate to text analytics. It also explores how language is structured and how meaning is conveyed through language. The module is designed to provide participants with a foundational understanding of linguistics and its applications in text analytics."
2,"Page 2 of the document 'S02 Essential Linguistics V1.3.pdf' discusses the definition and scope of linguistics as the scientific study of language. It explains that linguistics involves the analysis of the structure, meaning, and use of language, and that it is a multidisciplinary field that draws on various disciplines such as psychology, anthropology, and computer science. The document also mentions that linguistics helps us understand how language is acquired, how it varies across different cultures, and how it changes over time. It concludes by stating that linguistics is a dynamic and constantly evolving field that plays a crucial role in our understanding of human communication."
3,"This section discusses morphology, which is the study of word structure and part-of-speech categories. There are two main types of words: open-class words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) and closed-class words (pronouns, determiners, prepositions, conjunctions, numerals, auxiliary verbs). Parts of speech group words based on their distributional and morphological properties. Many words can have multiple parts of speech, such as ""book"" which can be a noun or a verb."
4,"NNP - Proper noun

The LDC Penn Tree Bank has a total of 36 POS tags, as well as 12 additional tags with more specific information, such as NNP for proper nouns. These tags are used to label and categorize words in a sentence, providing information on their grammatical role and function. They are commonly used in natural language processing tasks and can help with tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic analysis."
5,"Affixation is the process of adding affixes (prefixes or suffixes) to word stems to create new words. This can involve spelling changes, such as adding ""ability"" to ""able."" Inflectional suffixes create variations of the same part of speech (POS) as the stem, such as adding ""s"" or ""es"" to create plural nouns. Derivational affixes often change the meaning or POS of the word, such as adding ""teacher"" to ""teach."" There can be irregular forms and ambiguities, such as the different forms of ""corpus"" and the confusion between ""bore"" as a present tense or past tense word."
6,"This page discusses lexical features, which are used to describe words based on their syntactic categories and variant forms. These features include number (singular or plural), -type (mass, count, or name), person (first, second, or third), case (nominative or accusative), valence (intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, scomp, etc.), and -type (base, comparative, or superlative). Examples of these features are provided for words such as ""word/words,"" ""he/him,"" and ""old/older/oldest."""
7,"The concept of syntax is essential in understanding how words come together to form meaningful units such as words, phrases, and clauses. Parse trees are used to visually represent the syntactic structure of sentences, showing how these constituents are organized."
8,"Phrases are groups of words that function as a unit within a sentence. There are four main types of phrases: NP (noun phrases), VP (verb phrases), AP (adjectival phrases), and PP (prepositional phrases). These phrases have a head word, which is the main word that determines the type of phrase. For example, the head word of an NP is a noun. Other words in a phrase can modify the head word, such as determiners, numbers, adjectives, and postmodifiers like prepositional phrases or clauses. Similarly, a VP has a head verb and can include other constituents like NPs, PPs, and sentential complements. An AP has a head adjective and can be modified by"
9,"Page 9 of the document discusses different types of clauses, which are groups of words that contain a subject and a verb. The main categories of clauses are declarative, interrogative, imperative, relative, complement, and passive clauses. Declarative clauses make statements, interrogative clauses ask questions, imperative clauses give commands, relative clauses provide additional information about a noun, complement clauses serve as the object of a verb, and passive clauses show that the subject is being acted upon. Examples of each type of clause are provided."
10,"The grammatical relations of constituents in a sentence include the subject, direct object, indirect object, infinitive complement, and specifier/modifier. The subject performs the action in a sentence, while the direct object receives the action. The indirect object is the recipient of the direct object's action. The infinitive complement is a verb that follows the main verb and describes its purpose. Specifiers and modifiers provide additional information about the subject."
11,"Dependency relations refer to the way words in a sentence are connected to each other, with important information encoded in the structure. This is shown through labelled arcs from the main words to the words they are dependent on. These structures help to approximate the semantic relationships between the main words and their supporting words in a sentence."
12,"This page discusses dependency relations, which are grammatical relationships between words in a sentence. These relations are part of the Universal Dependency set, which is a standardized system for annotating linguistic data. Some of the key dependency relations mentioned on this page include subject, object, and modifier. These relations are important for understanding the structure and meaning of a sentence."
13,"Semantics is the study of the meaning of linguistic expressions, which can be represented through knowledge representation systems such as First-Order Logic or frames. Propositions, which consist of predicates and referring expressions, are used to express meaning. The correctness of propositions can be evaluated as true or false, and contradictions can arise when two propositions conflict. Ambiguity can occur when a sentence can convey more than one proposition. Entailment is the concept that the assertion of one proposition implies the truth of another, leading to inference."
14,"Pragmatics is the study of how language is used in context, both linguistically and situationally. It involves understanding the purpose and effects of utterances and speech acts, which can influence the actions and thoughts of the hearer. This includes the locution (physical utterance with context and reference), illocution (conveying intentions), and perlocution (resulting actions) of a statement. For example, when Monique says ""Open the window!"" to Steve, she is the speaker, he is the hearer, and the window is the object. Monique's illocution is for Steve to open the window, and the perlocution is that Steve actually opens the window. Pragmatics also"
15,"The resources listed on page 15 of the document 'S02 Essential Linguistics V1.3.pdf' include a book by Ted Brisco titled ""Introduction to Linguistics for Natural Language Processing"" and a research paper by Marcus, Mitchell, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz titled ""Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank."" These resources provide valuable information on linguistics and language processing, and can be used as references for further study."
