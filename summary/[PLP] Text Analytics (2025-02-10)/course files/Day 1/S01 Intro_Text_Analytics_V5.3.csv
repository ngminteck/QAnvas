Common measures of IAA include Cohen's Kappa, Fleiss's Kappa, Scott's Pi, Krippendorff's Alpha, and F-measure. IAA is important for evaluating and monitoring the quality of annotation."
31,"Cohen's Kappa is a measure of agreement for qualitative items that takes into account the possibility of chance agreement. It is calculated by subtracting the expected agreement from the observed agreement and dividing by the difference between 1 and the expected agreement. The expected agreement is calculated by dividing 1 by the number of observations squared, multiplied by the number of categories. This formula takes into account the number of categories, observations, and the number of times each annotator predicted a specific category."
32,"Page 32 of the document 'S01 Intro_Text_Analytics_V5.3.pdf' gives an example of Kappa, a statistical measure used to evaluate the performance of text classification models. The example shows a confusion matrix for a model that categorizes reviews as positive or negative. The Kappa score is calculated by comparing the model's accuracy to the expected accuracy based on random chance. A Kappa score of 1 indicates perfect agreement between the model and expected accuracy, while a score of 0 indicates no agreement. The example also mentions the importance of considering the baseline accuracy when interpreting Kappa scores."
33,"The interpretation of Kappa, a measure of inter-rater agreement, has been discussed by several researchers. Landis and Koch (1977) proposed guidelines for interpreting Kappa, while Krippendorff (1980) argued for a more nuanced approach. Green (1997) suggested that a Kappa value of 0.8 is a good threshold to use. More recently, Artstein and Poesio (2008) also recommended a threshold of 0.8 for Kappa."
34,"Page 34 discusses the use of F-measure in cases where the number of negative cases is unknown or very large. In these situations, average positive specific agreement is commonly used to quantify inter-annotator agreement (IAA). The average pairwise F-measure is used to calculate this agreement. The value of F for the example on page 28 is not mentioned."
