Page 15," Most of the ‘lift’ provided by data mining is provided by structured data . Text mining normally takes a small amount of data mining, but can be significant ."
Page 16," Many more tasks dealing with natural language text are dealing with  information extraction, parsing, text generation, summarization and machine translation ."
Page 17, The Text Analytics Process was created by NUS in 2013 . NUS is the world's largest provider of text analysis software . Text Analytics is a free form of analysis and analysis of text messages .

Page 19, The data understanding phase starts with an initial data collection and proceeds with activities in order to identify data quality problems . The data preparation phase covers all activities to construct the final dataset (data that will be fed into the model(s) from
Page 20, The NUS study aims to understand the business case and the purpose of the study . It also aims to identify available text data or use text data alone or … ?
Page 21," NUS: Collect Initial data, Describe data, Explore data and verify data quality . Assess the accessibility and usability of the data, and assess the quantity and quality of data . Identify the text data sources (digitized or"
Page 22," Data Preparation: Select data, Clean data, Construct new data, Integrate data, Format data, Establish the text corpus, etc. Preprocess the data, build stopword/include-word list, create TDM,"
Page 23, The text mining task is a text mining tool that can be used to classify/score text . The output of the categorization model may be input to other models (using structured data)
Page 24, The models developed and verified are addressing the business problem and satisfying the defined objectives of the study . The study was carried out by NUS in 2013-2025 .
Page 25," Models should be updated periodically with new data, says NUS . Deployment ranges from writing a report to integrating the model into BI systems ."

Page 27, Dictionaries are machine readable resources to improve TA systems on various processing steps . They include a filter dictionary (stopword list) and synonym dictionary (substitution dictionary)
Page 28, The corpora provides examples for statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to work . Quality of corpora is critical for the resulting models . Validity – correct (need ‘ground truth’ to measure) – Validity . Reliability
Page 29," Objective tasks - easier, subjective tasks - much harder . Define task and guidelines for annotators . Train the annotators (humans) Check self-agreement rate ."
Page 30, Inter-Annotator Agreement between multiple annotators (assumption: consistency implies consistency implies validity.) Common measures:– Cohen’s Kappa.– Fleiss's Kappa– Scott's Pi– Krippendorff�
Page 31, The agreement rate for qualitative items takes into account the  possibility of chance agreement . It is based on Cohen’s Kappa Kappa . The agreement rates are based on the number of observations made by annotators .
Page 32," The Kappa Kappa Kappa is an acronym for Kappa Kappa . Kappa Kappa was created by the University of Cambridge in 1968 . Kappa is a university of origin in the United States . Kappa was founded by the university of Cambridge, Cambridge, in 1968"
Page 33," NUS: Kappa is a good value if threshold needs to be set, 0.8 is good value . Krippendorff, Landis and Koch, 1977: “Kappa is a  good value.”"
Page 34," In some tasks, the number of negative cases can be unknown,  undefined or very large . IAA is commonly quantified using the average positive specific agreement - the average pairwise F-measure ."
Page 35, Tools & Solutions for Text Mining include text mining and text mining tools . NUS is the world's leading provider of text mining technology . Text mining tools can be used to mine text messages .
Page 36, Various commercial and Open-Source tools are available for use in the cloud . They include tools specialised for industry-specific or task-specific use cases .
Page 37," A Business Question is a question where if you knew the answer, you would act differently . The Business Question: How much skill do you have? How often are you going to do this? How much time is available?"
Page 38," Many factors to decide on the tool(s) include how general/flexible a tool should be . Vendor tools are expensive, but you get training and support . Courses can be tool specific, or tool independent ."
Page 39," Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT from OpenAI, are very powerful models trained to interact with user in a conversational manner . They are very versatile for language related tasks with proper prompting ."
