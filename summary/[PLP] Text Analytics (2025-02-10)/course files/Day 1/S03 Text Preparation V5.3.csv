Page 12,Term Document Matrix (TDM) uses terms (keywords) as features for the vectors to represent the documents . tokenization – Case lowering – Stemming/lemmatization .
Page 13,"word tokenization is used – unigram model – every token is a single word . there are also bigram, trigram models, where each token is composed of two/three words ."
Page 14,"tokenization is done by identifying token delimiters – Whitespace characters such as space, tab, newline – Punctuation characters like ( ) ! can be part of an abbreviation or"
Page 15,"a large vocabulary size can capture more specific information, but increases memory usage and computational cost . Usually handled by replacing unknown words with a special token ."

Page 17,a word may come in varied forms and therefore need to be converted into a standard form . Stemming can reduce the number of distinct features in a text corpus .

Page 19,an inflectional stemmer needs to be partly rule-based and partly dictionary-based . derivational stemming is more aggressive and therefore can reduce the number of features in a corpus drastically .

Page 34,the embeddings capture semantic or linguistic information of the words . lookup each token (word) in the vectors .
Page 35,a pre-trained (large) language model generates embedding for each word based on context . can handle different meanings of the same word with different contexts . great for tasks requiring word-level representation
