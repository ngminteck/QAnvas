Page 4," Employers are required to report any serious work-related injuries and death to the authority . This information helps employers, workers and the authority evaluate the safety of a workplace ."
Page 5, An example of such accident report is shown below: An example is shown here: A car accident report from a car involved in a car accident .
Page 6, Employee Suffers Burns When Caught In Flash Fire . Employee suffered burns when caught in flash fire . Employee suffers from burns after being caught in the flash of fire .
Page 7, Employee #1 was heating hot asphalt oil spray wand using a propane torch . During the heating of spray  wand a coworker accidentally pressed the nozzle control handle that blow out hot oil and diesel . A flash fire occurred and caught Employee
Page 8," In this mini-project, assume you are engaged by a client to perform text mining on the accident reports to help find answers to the following questions ."
Page 9, What are the major types of accidents reflected in the reports? What's the major type of accidents that reflect in the report? What is the type of accident that reflects in the accidents?
Page 10, Which type of accidents has the largest number of occurrences? Do you know what type of accident has the highest number of occurrence?
Page 11, Which part of the human body is injured most in the accidents? Which parts of the body are injured most? Do you know which part of your body is hurt most?

Page 18,Data understanding and exploration
Page 19, Load the data file and explore your data file . Use this data file to help you understand more about your data .
Page 20, How many records there are there? How many variables? We need to know how many variables are there . How many record-breaking records are there: How many people are involved?
Page 21, Examine the first few records in the datasets . Examine a few of the datasets. Examine how they were used to create the dataset .
Page 22, What information does the dataset contain? Which fields are useful for your study? Use the dataset to help students understand more about the data .
Page 23, How long are the reports generally? How long is the titles? What do you know about the titles you receive from these reports?
Page 24, How’s the data quality? Any abnormal titles or reports? [Hint: checking number of tokens in each title/report]
Page 25, What are the contents of the reports roughly? [ Hint: create a word frequency distribution for the dataset . What are those reports' contents roughly? Use the dataset to find out .
Page 26, Use your results to answer the questions in “Day 1 – Quiz 3” [Note: use your results in the next quiz to answer questions in the previous quiz .
Page 27, Report: What are the major types of accidents reflected in the reports? Q1. Q1 . Q2. Q3. Q4. Q5. Q10. Q11. Q12. Q13. Q14.
Page 28,Are there labels available?
Page 29, Is the task supervised or unsupervised? Is it supervised or supervised? Do you have a job that needs to be supervised or not supervised? Take a test to see if you want to make sure you know what you need to do
Page 30," Classification or clustering? Or topic modelling? We ask you to share your knowledge of topics in our new book, The World of the Year ."
