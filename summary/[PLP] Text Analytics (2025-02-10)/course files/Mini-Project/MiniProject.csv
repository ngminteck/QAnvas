41,"The document contains a set of data called Lemma_data, which is organized into multiple lists. Each list contains a set of lemmas, with some lemmas potentially repeating within the same list."
42,"function

The document frequency of a list can be obtained by converting the list into a set, flattening the list, and then using the FreqDist function. This allows for a more accurate representation of the frequency of words in a list, as sets do not contain duplicate elements and the FreqDist function calculates the frequency of each unique element. This method can be useful for analyzing the frequency of words in a text or document."
43,"The code on page 43 of the document 'MiniProject.docx' creates a new list called ""Unique"" that contains unique elements from another list called ""lemma_data"". This is done by using the set() function to remove any duplicate elements from the list and then using the list() function to convert it back to a list. This results in a list of unique elements from the original list."
44,"The document explains how to obtain a list of body-related terms from WordNet, a lexical database for the English language. WordNet categorizes words into different synsets, or sets of synonyms, and provides definitions and relationships between words. To get a list of body terms, one can use the ""body"" synset and its hyponyms (subcategories) in WordNet. This will provide a comprehensive list of body-related terms such as ""arm,"" ""leg,"" ""head,"" and ""torso."" This list can be used for various purposes, such as building a body-related vocabulary or conducting research on body-related concepts."
45,The document discusses the process of using FreqDist to obtain document frequencies for body terms. This involves sorting the results and checking them to ensure accuracy.
