Page 4,"employers are required to report any serious work-related injuries and death to the authority . this information helps employers, workers and the authority to evaluate the safety of a workplace, understand industry hazards and implement worker protections to reduce and eliminate hazards"
Page 5,an example of such accident report is shown below . a similar accident report has been reported in a recent accident .
Page 6,Employee Suffers Burns When Caught In Flash Fire . Employee suffers burns when caught In flash fire .
Page 7,employee # 1 was heating hot asphalt oil spray wand using a propane torch . a coworker accidentally pressed the nozzle control handle that blow out hot oil and diesel . employee #1 was treated for second degree burn
Page 8,assume you are engaged by a client to perform text mining on accident reports to help find answers to the following questions .
Page 9,"what are the major types of accidents reflected in the reports? how many accidents are caused in the report? if you have a problem with the report, please contact us."
Page 10,which type of accidents has the largest number of occurrences? which types of accidents have the biggest number of accidents?
Page 11,which part of the human body is injured most in the accidents? which part is the most injured in the collisions?
Page 12,the dataset is in file osha.txt . the data is in the file . .

Page 18,Data understanding and exploration
Page 19,Load the data file and explore your data . click here to view your data and view it in the comments .
Page 20,"how many records are there? How many variables? how many variables do you have . if you don't have a record, what variables are you able to use?"
Page 21,"examine the first few records in the datasets . if you have any questions, please contact us at the bottom of the page."
Page 22,"what information does the dataset contain? which fields are useful for your study? if you have any questions, please contact us today ."
Page 23,how long are the reports generally? How long are titles? what are the titles? how long is the titles .
Page 24,check number of tokens in each title/report . how is the data quality? any abnormal titles or reports?
Page 25,"what are the contents of the reports roughly . create a word frequency distribution for the dataset . if you have a problem with the data, you should be able to use the data ."
Page 26,"use your results to answer the questions in 'Day 1 – Quiz 3' [Note: use the results for your answers to the question in ""day 1 - quiz 3""."
Page 27,what are the major types of accidents reflected in the reports? how are the accidents impacted by the reports .
Page 28,Are there labels available?
Page 29,"Is the task supervised or unsupervised? if the task is unsupervised, it will be supervised ."
Page 30,"classification or clustering? or topic modelling? i.e., topic modelling . iii ."
Page 31,"which column to use? title or details? . if you want to use a column, which column should be used?"
Page 32,"which type of accidents has more occurrences? Q2 which types of accidents have more? if there are more accidents, which type has more accidents?"
Page 33,"once you have the model from Q1, it’s straight-forward to get the number of reports wrt topic reports ."
Page 34,"which part of the human body is injured most? Q3 - which part is hurt most? if you are injured, you may be injured ."
Page 35,extract the mentioning of injured body parts in the text . then count (in what way?) in what way .
Page 36,Which column to use?
Page 37,"how to identify ""body part"" words? need case lowering, lemmatization, possibility ."
Page 38,"any ambiguities? (e.g. is “hand” always referring to hand? ). if you have a ambiguity, you may be wondering if it is a hand ."
Page 39,"preprocess report text: pos tagging, lemmatization => keep the nouns (lemma)"
Page 40,"lemma_data = [ [ lem1, lem2, lem3, lem1...] , [ ], [ [], [ ] ."
Page 41,"turn the lists into sets: set(list_1) . flatten the list, then the FreqDist ."
Page 42,Unique = [ list(set(leml)] for leml in lemma_data .
