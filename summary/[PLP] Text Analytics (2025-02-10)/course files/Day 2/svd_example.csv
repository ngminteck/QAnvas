1,"This document provides an example of computing the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a matrix A. The singular values are found by finding the eigenvalues of AAT, which in this case are 5 and 3. The right singular vectors (columns of V) are then found by finding an orthonormal set of eigenvectors of AT A. The eigenvalues of AT A are 25, 9, and 0, and the eigenvectors are found to be orthogonal. The last eigenvector is found by computing the kernel of AT A or finding a unit vector perpendicular to the previous two eigenvectors."
2,"The document discusses the calculation of the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix A. The formula for the SVD is A = UΣV T, where U and V are orthogonal matrices and Σ is a diagonal matrix with the singular values of A. The document provides the values for U and Σ, and shows how to compute U using the formula σui = Avi. The final SVD is then shown as A = UΣV T = ( 1/ √ 2 1 / √ 2 1/ √ 2 −1/ √ [REDACTED_PHONE] )  1/ √ 2 1 /"
