Page 48,IE Methods are based on a rule-based IE method . IE methods are used in the IE process .
Page 49,"rule-based systems can and do work well . corpus is relatively static (in terms of vocabulary, language structure, etc.)"
Page 50,[REDACTED_PHONE] NUS. All rights reserved. page 50 What does a rule look like?
Page 51,IE recognition rules are more natural for hand-coded rules . patterns are considered independent . a lot of rules are based on a number of criteria .
Page 52,"ruleType: ""tokens"", pattern: ([word:$COMPANY_BEGINNING & tag:""NNP""]+ . ""COMPA"
Page 53,"regular expressions are very useful in extracting concepts expressed in a certain way . e.g. currency, dates, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, etc."
Page 54,"special characters (operators) are used to define character patterns Operator Purpose . match any single character E.g. .in matches both Windows, and Linux ."
