The case study presented in this document is about a 5th grade student named Emily who struggles with writing. She has difficulty organizing her ideas and often gets stuck on what to write. The teacher used the SRSD (Self-Regulated Strategy Development) approach to help Emily improve her writing skills. This approach involves teaching students specific writing strategies, such as planning, drafting, revising, and editing. Emily was also taught how to self-monitor her writing using a checklist. With the help of this approach, Emily was able to improve her writing skills and become more confident in her abilities. This case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the SRSD approach in helping students with writing difficulties."
10,"Landing.AI has created an AI tool to help customers monitor social distancing in the workplace. The tool uses computer vision to detect and track people in a given space, and alerts users when social distancing guidelines are not being followed. It can also provide data and insights on social distancing compliance over time. This solution is designed to help businesses ensure the safety of their employees and comply with social distancing regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic."
