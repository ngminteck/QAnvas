4,"This slide discusses the importance of setting goals and expectations for an internship. It emphasizes the need for clear communication between the intern and supervisor in order to establish realistic and achievable goals. It also highlights the importance of being proactive and taking initiative in order to make the most of the internship experience. Additionally, it mentions the importance of being open to feedback and learning from mistakes. Finally, the slide reminds interns to stay organized and keep track of their progress towards their goals."
5,"To get started with your internship, it is important to be proactive and self-source projects. This means looking for projects from any company that meet the criteria set by the internship program. Once you have found a suitable project, you must submit a formal proposal through TalentConnect (TC) for review and approval. Don't be afraid to approach lecturers for guidance and to discuss the feasibility of your chosen project."
6,"After being approved for an internship, students must submit a scanned copy of their internship agreement to the TC and fill out the Internship Survey on Canvas. They have until the end of March 2025 to change their projects, but must re-upload the new project to the TC for approval and update the Internship Survey on Canvas."
7,"This slide outlines the two ways to get started with an internship: reactive and proactive. The reactive approach involves applying through TalentConnect and Canvas, where the proposal has already been approved. Once both parties agree, there are no more options through TalentConnect and Canvas."
8,"To get started with an internship through ISS, students can either wait for project proposals to be released or actively search for opportunities on CANVAS or TalentConnect. They will then submit their CV to the company and go through a job interview if shortlisted. Once an agreement is reached, students are expected to commit to the internship and cannot quit. The company's HR department will issue a Letter of Offer with clearly stated terms and conditions, including a recommended monthly stipend of 1500S$. It should be noted that some internships may be unpaid."
9,"After being selected for an internship, there are two steps that need to be completed. The first step is to fill out the Internship Survey on Canvas. The second step is to fill out and submit the IAP form on Canvas, but this step is only necessary if the project is from Canvas and can be skipped if the project is from TC."
10,"This slide reminds students that there is no negotiation of stipend for their internship and once they have signed the offer letter, they cannot withdraw. Therefore, they should carefully choose their projects."
11,"During the internship, students must inform their company supervisor before 10am if they need to take a medical leave. They must also scan and upload their medical certificate to their ISS Advisor as soon as possible. If a student takes more than 5 days of medical leave throughout the internship, the ISS disciplinary board may review the case and potentially terminate the internship. Personal leaves are not allowed unless explicitly agreed upon by the company HR or supervisor. In case of an urgent personal leave, students must seek approval from their ISS Advisor and company supervisor in advance, and it will be considered on a case-by-case basis."
12,"Disputes can occur in the workplace due to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and differing expectations. If a dispute arises with a supervisor or team member, it is important to sit down and discuss the problem in a professional and amicable manner. If this does not resolve the issue, the ISS advisor can be approached for assistance. It is the intern's responsibility to bring any issues to the attention of their ISS advisor."
13,"The key points on slide 13 of page 13 of the 'Internship-StudentBriefing.pdf' document focus on work attitude. It is important for interns to avoid criticizing the organization, their supervisors, colleagues, and team members. Instead, they should be constructive in their approach. Interns should also refrain from engaging in office politics and gossip. If they need to leave the office, they must seek permission from their supervisor. It is also important to keep their supervisor informed before meeting with users. Interns should be mindful of deadlines and deliverables and be punctual in reporting to work."
14,"During your internship, it is important to maintain a positive work attitude by avoiding non-project related activities during your free time, refraining from loitering in certain areas, and adhering to company rules and regulations. It is also important to provide your mobile number to your company supervisor and ISS advisors and to not engage in any moonlighting activities during the internship period."
15,"If you are terminated from your internship due to failure to perform assigned tasks, repeated lateness or absences, a bad attitude, or violating company policies, you will automatically fail the Capstone module and be dismissed from the Master's degree program and the university. It is important to take your internship seriously in order to avoid this outcome."

These companies include Active Intelligence, Autodesk, Boehringer Ingelheim, Crayon Data, Crimson Logic, CSC, Decision Science Agency Pte Ltd, Garena, IBM Singapore/Ireland, HP Inc, Infineon, ISI Dentsu, Integral Solution, Keppel Corp, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Just Analytics, JLT Interactive, Lynx Analytics, Mobius Innovations, NTUC Income, NUS, ThoughtBuzz, UnionPay, Ventes Pte.
