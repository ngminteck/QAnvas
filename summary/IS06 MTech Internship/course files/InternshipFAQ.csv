1,"The document outlines frequently asked questions about internships for students at the National University of Singapore Institute of Systems Science (NUS-ISS). It clarifies that students cannot do projects based on recommendations from seniors or alumni, and that project scope must be clearly stated and approved. Internships outside of Singapore are possible with approval from ISS, but students must physically be in Singapore for exams. Projects not involving AI skills will not be approved, and any major changes to the project scope must be approved before proceeding. Only one internship project can be registered for the capstone, and changing project sponsors is only allowed for self-sourced projects before the cut-off date. Any changes to project scope with the same sponsor company must also be approved."
2,"The document states that interns may terminate their internship if their sponsor company agrees and they have completed at least 20+1 weeks of full-time work. Non-paid internships are not easier than paid ones. Interns cannot start their internship earlier than the official start date, unless it is a part-time role. Extensions may be possible with sponsor company approval, but the internship must end before the student pass expiry date. Presentations must be done live through Zoom and teams are allowed for projects, but individual reports must be submitted. There are no templates provided, and if the internship work is confidential, interns should not submit the source code or data set but must present and submit slides and reports after validation by their company supervisor.
