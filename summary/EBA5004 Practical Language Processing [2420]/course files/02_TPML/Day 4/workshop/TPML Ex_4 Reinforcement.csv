Page 1,Day 4. Text processing for Machine Learning Exercise
Page 2,Task: Complete the current word token given the previous words and the leading one or two letters of the word token .
Page 3,Example:
Page 4,"input: Hi Everyone, Good mo"
Page 5,"output: Hi Everyone, Good morning"
Page 6,use Re-enforcement learning method to build an NN Agent (NN/CNN/LSTM/Transformer) to finish this task.
Page 7,To think about steps:
Page 8,How to prepare the training data?
Page 9,Which model could be the agent?
Page 10,How to design the reward?
Page 11,Any other steps that matteringâ€¦
Page 12,Try it out with the help of GPT/Copilot step by step . Try it with the aid of gpt/copilot .
Page 13,"if your Agent is not going to work, it is OK if that is the case . if it is not possible to get your Agent to come to your home ."
Page 14,Present and propose possible solutions for each of the steps you have identified . present and propose different solutions based on the steps identified above .
Overall Summary,use Re-enforcement learning method to build an NN Agent to finish this task . it is OK if your Agent is not going to work . present and propose possible solutions for each of the steps you have identified .
