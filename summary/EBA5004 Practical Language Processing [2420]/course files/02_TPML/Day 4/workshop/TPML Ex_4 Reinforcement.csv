Page 2,task: Complete the current word token given the previous words and the leading one or two letters of the actual word token .
Page 3,Example:
Page 4,"input: Hi Everyone, Good mo"
Page 5,"output: Hi Everyone, Good morning"
Page 6,use Re-enforcement learning method to build an NN Agent (NN/CNN/LSTM/Transformer) to finish this task.
Page 7,To think about steps:
Page 8,How to prepare the training data?
Page 9,Which model could be the agent?
Page 10,How to design the reward?
Page 11,Any other steps that matteringâ€¦
Page 12,"Try it out with the help of GPT/Copilot step by step . if you have any questions, please contact the GPT or Copilot team."
Page 13,your Agent is not going to work . it is OK if your agent isn't going to be able to work.
Page 14,present and propose possible solutions for each of the steps you have identified . propose solutions to each step you have chosen .
Overall Summary,text processing for machine learning exercise task: complete the current word token given the previous words and the leading one or two letters of the current words token . NN Agent (NN/CNN/LSTM/Transformer) will finish this task .
