Custom UI may be preferred for virtual assistants to have tighter control. Effective voice interaction may also require diverse language support and awareness of dialects, slang, and accents. More advanced systems may need to utilize visual and sensor data in addition to voice."
18,"The document discusses the language processing capabilities of NLP and intent matching in applications. It highlights the importance of sentence re-writing and tagging semantic entities in improving intent matching accuracy. The NLP engine may need specific tailoring for different industries and tasks, potentially through training. While it is beneficial to have chatbots that can learn from user interactions, real-time unsupervised learning can make them vulnerable to attacks. Translation can expand language support, but it is not as effective as native understanding."
19,"The document discusses the language processing capabilities needed for effective intent matching, including the use of contextual clues and grouping intents for scalability. It also mentions the possibility of an input having multiple intents and an intent having multiple handlers. Key information, or slots, must be extracted through pattern recognition. Users may modify or bring in new intents before the existing one is handled. The use of pretrained intents available in a marketplace can greatly reduce development time."
20,"Contextual awareness capabilities are essential for intent matching in applications that are used frequently. This includes past conversations with the user, external information such as current time and location, and user preferences and profiles. A proactive chatbot can initiate dialogues based on events and rules, but it is important to strike a balance between being helpful and intrusive for successful implementation."
21,"Page 21 of the document 'CNI_Day1_v3.pdf' discusses the intent handling capabilities of chatbots. The most common method is a decision tree with scripted dialogue, but brokering is necessary when multiple handlers are available for one intent. Slot filling is used for transactional conversation, and with a knowledge repository, chatbots can take user input as a query and search for relevant results or map to a node in the repository to extract an answer. Chatbots are also expected to engage in small talk."
22,"The response generation capabilities for chatbots include natural language generation (NLG) that is more advanced than pre-scripted responses. These responses can be personalized based on factors like style and culture. They can also be converted from text to speech to create human-like voices. To add personality, facial expressions and actions can be generated for brand projection or bot persona. Additionally, intermediary dialogue can be generated to reduce latency while the user is waiting."
23,"Integration capabilities are important for chatbots, as many use cases require them to be integrated with existing systems. Chatbots can also communicate with other bots using natural language."
24,"The document discusses the importance of handling error situations in an effective and efficient manner. It suggests several ways to handle errors, such as asking clarifying questions, switching to alternatives like a website or search engine, passing the request to human operators, and generating reports with performance metrics. It also emphasizes the need to identify areas of improvement and monitor the quality of key modules to flag potential problems. These measures can help improve the overall user experience and ensure a smooth functioning of the system."

The market for conversational platforms is growing, with major players like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Tencent leading the way. These platforms use artificial intelligence and natural language processing to enable conversation-based interactions. They are being integrated into various devices and services, such as smart speakers and"
26,"End-to-end dialog systems use large language models, such as sequence-to-sequence and augmented autoregressive transformers, to generate responses based on input conversation history. These models are trained with dialogue data and can also be trained on conversation-like data. The goal is to generate the most likely response given a prompt. This technology is expected to be used in various applications, such as virtual assistants and chatbots."
27,"The document discusses various end-to-end language models such as BlenderBot, DialoGPT, GODEL, Meena, LaMDA, Sparrow, GPT3.5/4, Claude, LlaMa, etc. These models have strong natural language understanding and generation capabilities, some with multi-lingual support. They are versatile and flexible, making them useful for open-ended conversations and handling a wide range of topics without explicit training. These models are also helpful in applications like NPCs in games. Additionally, large language models have shown potential for other tasks beyond conversation, such as conversational AI."
28,"The use of LLMs (Language and Learning Machines) poses several challenges, including the risk of providing incorrect or outdated information, bias in responses, and difficulty managing multi-step transactions. There are also concerns about security risks, integration challenges, and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. LLMs must also handle sensitive data securely and comply with regulations. Additionally, there are limitations in terms of multimodal capabilities, reliability, and error handling."
29,"The article discusses the limitations of using large language models (LLMs) alone and highlights the importance of operationalizing them through a LLM as-a-service approach. It explains that LLMs require significant computational resources and expertise to train and deploy, making it difficult for organizations to fully utilize them. By using LLM as-a-service, organizations can access pre-trained models and use them for specific tasks, without the need for extensive resources or expertise. This approach allows for more efficient and effective use of LLMs, leading to better results and insights."
30,"Prompts are important in providing context for a model and should be structured by separating messages into different roles: the system for contexts, the user for input, and the chatbot/assistant for output. This helps to ground the model and improve context setting."
31,"The document discusses the importance of incorporating external data into End-to-End systems to improve their performance. This has been achieved by injecting external data into the input context of the model. This approach has been successful in task-based applications such as ticket booking, food ordering, and taxi booking. The authors propose a method called Godel, which involves pre-training the model on a large-scale dataset for goal-directed dialog, in order to improve its performance on these tasks."
32,"The use of external data in LLM for informational chatbots is important for providing accurate and relevant information. This data should be specific to the domain and not already included in the language model. The chatbot should also have the ability to remember past interactions with users, with a certain window size. This can be achieved through returning the last K messages, a summary of those messages, or extracting information from stored messages. A suggested resource for implementing this is the python.langchain.com website."
33,"Chatbots can perform actions beyond just generating responses by using tool calling. This allows them to book flights, order food, and retrieve real-time and knowledge-base information. LLM, a tool for chatbots, can act as an intelligent API caller by using API endpoints, specifications, and natural language descriptions. It decides when to call relevant APIs based on user queries and generates structured outputs. The results from the API are then used to generate appropriate responses based on context. An example of this is the OpenAI Assistants API, which supports tools such as Code Interpreter, File Search, and Function Calling."
34,"The tool calling flow on page 34 outlines the process of making a call using a tool. First, the user initiates the call by selecting a contact and clicking the call button. The tool then sends a request to the network, which routes the call to the recipient's device. The recipient's device then sends a response to the tool, which establishes a connection between the two devices. During the call, the tool and network handle functions such as call duration, call quality, and call termination. Once the call is ended, the tool and network update call records and disconnect the devices."
35,"Page 35 of the document discusses the importance of human conversation and how it is an essential part of our daily lives. It highlights the fact that conversations allow for the exchange of information, ideas, and emotions, leading to better understanding and connection between individuals. The document also emphasizes the role of technology in changing the dynamics of human conversation, but stresses the importance of maintaining face-to-face interactions for effective communication. It concludes by stating that human conversation is a vital aspect of our social and emotional well-being."
36,"The exercise on page 36 of 'CNI_Day1_v3.pdf' suggests finding a task-based chatbot online and interacting with it, or recalling a previous experience using a chatbot for a task. Participants are then asked to state the objective of the chatbot, three things they like about it, and three things they don't like. If the chatbot is not powered by LLM, participants are asked to suggest how an LLM could help resolve the disliked features. If it is LLM-powered, participants are asked to suggest ways to improve it. The group will share their experiences at a designated time."
37,"The conversation is about a person needing to travel to Seattle for a meeting from May 12th to 15th. They discuss flight options and decide on taking a non-stop flight on May 11th at 5:55pm and returning on May 15th, which is a Friday. The person then considers staying an extra day until Sunday and the other person notes that they have options for that day as well."
38,"The concept of turn-taking is an important aspect of conversations, where speakers take turns to contribute to the dialogue. This can involve single or multiple sentences. Effective turn-taking relies on cues such as sentence structure, intonation, eye gaze, and body language. Interruptions and corrections can also occur during turn-taking."
39,"Speech acts are not just about conveying information, but also about performing actions. There are different types of speech acts, including representatives, commissives, directives, declarations, expressives, and verdictives. Representatives involve making assertions or statements, while commissives involve promises or threats. Directives are commands or requests, while declarations involve formal actions such as blessings or firings. Expressives express psychological states or attitudes, and verdictives involve making assessments or rankings. These speech acts can also be combined, such as in representational declarations like ""You're out!"""
40,"The organization of conversation involves certain patterns known as adjacency pairs, where certain turns are followed by specific responses. These include question-answer pairs, invitations and their acceptance or rejection with explanation, apologies and acknowledgements. Opening sequences typically involve greetings followed by comments on topics such as weather or sports, while closing sequences involve summing up and farewells. Repairs and corrections may also occur during a conversation, and clarification questions are used to seek further understanding."
41,"Conversations can have different levels of control and initiative, with one speaker leading the conversation or both participants sharing the initiative. In some cases, the hearer may need to make inferences to fully understand the meaning of an utterance. For example, when someone says they need to be at a meeting from the 12th to the 15th, the hearer may need to infer that the meeting is taking place over multiple days. These aspects of conversation can impact how effectively information is communicated and understood."
42,"The concept of being cooperative in communication is essential for efficient communication between conversational participants. This is known as the Cooperative Principle. Grice's Maxims, which include the Maxim of Quality, Quantity, Relevance, and Manner, provide guidelines for effective communication. These maxims emphasize the importance of speaking truthfully, providing the right amount of information, contributing relevant information, and communicating clearly without obscurity or ambiguity."
43,"Page 43 of the document 'CNI_Day1_v3.pdf' discusses the importance of conversation design in creating effective human-computer interactions. This involves understanding the context and goals of the conversation, designing a conversational flow, and creating appropriate responses. Other key points include the use of natural language processing and machine learning to improve conversation design, the importance of user testing and iteration, and the potential ethical implications of conversation design. Effective conversation design can enhance user experience and improve the overall performance of conversational interfaces."
44,"Conversation design is a design language that combines various design disciplines, such as voice user interface design, interaction design, and audio design, to create a human-like conversation experience. The role of the designer in conversation design is to map out the user's actions, consider their needs and technology constraints, and create a detailed design specification that represents the complete user experience. This involves creating a persona for the system and user, and writing a screenplay for the core experiences."
45,"The process of conversation design involves several key steps, including understanding the user's needs and goals, identifying the appropriate technology and platforms, creating a conversation flow, designing the user interface, integrating natural language processing, and testing and refining the conversation. It is important to consider the user's context and preferences, as well as the capabilities and limitations of the chosen technology. The conversation flow should be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear prompts and options for the user to choose from. Natural language processing helps to make the conversation more human-like and can be customized for different languages and dialects. Regular testing and refinement are necessary to ensure the conversation is effective and meets the user's needs."
46,"The first step in determining whether conversation is the right fit for a task is to consider the purpose and goals of the task. If the task requires critical thinking, complex problem-solving, or deep learning, conversation may not be the most effective approach. However, if the goal is to build relationships, foster creativity, or promote collaboration, conversation may be a suitable method. It is important to carefully consider the task at hand before deciding whether conversation is the appropriate approach."
47,"Step 2 of the design process involves gathering requirements for the project. This includes identifying the users and their needs, as well as how they currently complete tasks. It is important to understand the words and phrases they use and the situations that trigger their tasks. Additionally, technical capabilities such as systems and data need to be identified, including how to identify users and save their progress. The format and length of session information should also be considered. It is recommended to focus on the most impactful use cases and to use a template if available."
48,"Creating a persona is an important step in the design process. It involves comparing the design without a persona to the design with a persona. A persona is a fictional representation of a user that helps designers understand their target audience. It includes details such as demographics, behaviors, and goals. By creating a persona, designers can better empathize with their users and make design decisions that cater to their needs and preferences. This ultimately leads to a more effective and user-friendly design."
49,"To create a persona for interacting with users, brainstorm a list of adjectives that describe the persona's perceived qualities. Narrow down to 4-6 and choose one. Then, create a visual representation and choose a consistent voice, whether it is synthesized or recorded."
50,"The persona example on page 50 of the document 'CNI_Day1_v3.pdf' discusses the importance of creating a persona for a chatbot. A persona is a fictional character that represents the chatbot and helps to humanize it. This can make the chatbot more relatable and engaging for users. The example provided is a chatbot for a fictional airline named ""FlyHigh"". The persona for this chatbot is a friendly and helpful flight attendant named ""Sky"". The document also highlights the key elements of a persona, such as name, personality, and tone. It emphasizes the importance of creating a persona that aligns with the brand and target audience."
51,The page discusses AI characters with personas and provides a link to interact with them on a website called NPC Arcade. This allows users to engage with AI characters that have distinct personalities and behaviors. The website is owned by the National University of Singapore and is set to launch in 2025.
52,"shared with the user â¢ Provide information that is truthful, relevant, and clear

When writing a sample dialog, it is important to keep in mind the key features of conversation, such as turn taking and the Cooperative Principle. To ensure that the user does not feel overwhelmed, clear prompts should be given for them to take action, and turns should be brief and relevant. It is also important to remember the contextual information shared with the user and to provide truthful, relevant, and clear information. These guidelines will help create an effective and user-friendly conversation."
53,"The example on page 53 of the document 'CNI_Day1_v3.pdf' illustrates the importance of avoiding monologues in presentations. Monologues, which are long, uninterrupted speeches, can be boring and disengaging for the audience. Instead, presenters should aim for a dialogue with the audience, encouraging participation and interaction. This can be achieved through techniques such as asking questions, using visual aids, and incorporating group activities. By avoiding monologues and promoting dialogue, presenters can create a more engaging and effective presentation."
54,"â

The cooperative principle is a fundamental concept in communication that states that speakers and listeners are expected to cooperate in order to achieve effective communication. This means that speakers should provide relevant and truthful information, while listeners should actively try to understand the speaker's intended meaning. Violating this principle can lead to misunderstandings and breakdowns in communication. The example of ""âÃâ"" illustrates the principle, as both the speaker and listener must cooperate in understanding the mathematical equation."
55,"The content on page 55 of the document 'CNI_Day1_v3.pdf' discusses an example of a company using the concept of âÃ to improve their business processes. This company, a large retailer, implemented a system that allows them to track and analyze customer purchases in real-time. This has helped them to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior, allowing them to make data-driven decisions to improve their sales and customer experience. The system also allows them to personalize marketing strategies and promotions for different customer segments. As a result, the company has seen significant improvements in their sales and customer satisfaction."
56,"The context of a conversation is important for understanding a user's question. This includes knowledge of previous turns in the dialog, such as pronouns referring to previously mentioned entities and omitted nouns. References to what is on the screen and information like the user's location and current time can also provide important context."
57,"of research projects


The document provides examples of research projects conducted at the National University of Singapore in 2025.

58,"The document discusses the importance of choosing appropriate prompts for conversational interfaces. These prompts can be spoken or displayed, or a combination of both. The conversation should start with a greeting to welcome the user and set expectations, allowing the user to take control. The conversation should also include endings to check if the user needs further assistance, information statements, questions to gather necessary information, acknowledgements, confirmations, and apologies if necessary. These prompts help create a smooth and user-friendly conversational experience."
59,"chime

On page 59, the document discusses various components that are commonly used in conversational interfaces. These include error messages, suggestions for alternative phrasing, commands for specific actions, discourse markers to indicate a change in topic, clickable options or actions known as ""chips,"" and non-verbal audio icons called earcons. These components are important for creating a smooth and efficient conversation between the user and the interface."
60,"When creating content, it is important to focus on the user and avoid using technical jargon or sophisticated language. Instead, use everyday language and common terminology to make the conversation more friendly and informal. It is also recommended to add variation by randomizing and choosing from a few conversational alternatives. This will make the content more engaging for the user."
61,"The document discusses high level flows in the context of network infrastructure. High level flows refer to the overall traffic patterns and data movement within a network, including the flow of data between different devices and systems. These flows can be classified into three categories: east-west, north-south, and internal. East-west flows refer to data moving between devices within a single network, while north-south flows refer to data moving between different networks. Internal flows refer to data moving within a single device or system. Understanding and managing these flows is crucial for optimizing network performance and security. Different tools and techniques can be used to monitor and analyze high level flows, such as flow analysis and packet capture."
62,"The document discusses the high level flows for the CNI Day 1 program, which is a workshop designed to introduce participants to the basics of computer networking.

These questions may come from stakeholders, users, or technical teams and can range from practical concerns to more complex issues. It is important for project teams to anticipate and address these questions in order to ensure a successful implementation. The document provides a list of common questions and suggests ways to approach them, such as providing clear communication and involving key stakeholders in decision-making. It also emphasizes the importance of continuously evaluating and adapting the implementation process to address any emerging questions or challenges."
64,"The document discusses errors that can occur in human-to-human and human-to-computer conversations. These errors include not responding, confusing responses, and asking for impossible tasks in human-to-human conversations. In human-to-computer conversations, errors can occur when there is no input from the user, no understanding of the user's response, or technical issues preventing the completion of a task. These errors can hinder effective communication and should be addressed in the design and development of conversational interfaces."
65,"The document discusses error handling in conversational interfaces. In cases where there is no match for the user's input, the first level response should be a brief and direct reprompt, avoiding over-explaining or providing examples for simple responses. If there is still no match after the first reprompt, the second level response should include additional support such as options, examples, or visual information. It is important to avoid repeating the same response multiple times. If there is still no match after the second attempt, the conversation should be ended gracefully to avoid user frustration. The user should also be informed of alternative ways to complete their task, but vague promises should be avoided to maintain user confidence."
66,"The document discusses error handling for situations where there is no input from the user. Possible causes for this include the user not speaking loud enough or not responding at all. The first level of handling this error is to assume the user hasn't heard the question and to repeat or rephrase it in a concise way. If the question is broad, options can be given. If the information is not required, the conversation can move on to the next step. The second level is to restate the question and give the user one more chance to respond before exiting. If there is still no response, the conversation will end gracefully."
67,"When handling system errors, it is important to account for all possible errors that may occur and provide clear explanations for the reason and possible next steps. It is important to be transparent, honest, and helpful in communicating the error to the user. Avoid using technical jargon that may confuse the user."
68,Testing is a crucial aspect of software development as it helps to identify and fix any errors or bugs in the code. It ensures that the software functions as intended and meets the desired requirements. Testing also helps to improve the overall quality and reliability of the software. It is important to conduct thorough and comprehensive testing to ensure a smooth and successful deployment of the software. Proper testing can save time and resources in the long run by preventing costly mistakes and delays.
69,"The fifth step in the design process is to test and iterate. This involves conducting usability tests, using sample dialogs and observing people's reactions. The design should also be tested in simulators and feedback should be gathered from users to determine their experience, whether it meets their expectations, and if they are satisfied. Based on user behavior, changes should be made to address confusion, frustration, impatience, and unexpected utterances."
70,"The sixth step in creating a successful digital experience is to focus on the key use cases and ensure that they are well-supported. It is also important to adequately support less common detours that users may take. For highly uncommon paths, a minimally viable solution such as generic prompts may be sufficient. This will help to ensure that the overall experience remains user-friendly and efficient."
71,"In Step 7 of designing for conversational interfaces, it is important to consider the different devices that may be used for the conversation, such as smart speakers, headphones, or smart displays. The design should also account for the transition from spoken conversation to multimodal conversation, including spoken and display prompts, as well as visual elements like images, media responses, tables, lists, and links. This will ensure a seamless and effective user experience across various devices."
72,"The style of language used in communication should prioritize the user and avoid monologues. It is important to use everyday language and common terminology, rather than technical jargon and sophisticated language. Keeping the conversation friendly and informal can also be helpful. Additionally, adding variation by randomizing and choosing from a few conversational alternatives can make the communication more engaging."
73,"The process of evaluating conversational user interfaces involves considering the user experience, functionality, and effectiveness of the interface. This can be done through user testing, analyzing user feedback, and evaluating the performance of the interface. It is important to consider the context in which the interface will be used and to continuously gather and incorporate user feedback to improve the interface. Additionally, evaluating the technical aspects of the interface, such as its natural language processing capabilities, is crucial for ensuring its effectiveness."
74,"The document discusses the importance of testing conversational user interface (UI) systems, specifically in terms of performance evaluation, diagnostic evaluation, and adequacy evaluation. Performance evaluation involves testing the system and its components, such as speech recognition, natural language understanding, intent matching, dialog management, natural language generation, and text-to-speech synthesis. Diagnostic evaluation is used to identify design and implementation errors, while adequacy evaluation assesses how well the system meets its objectives and user expectations. These evaluations are crucial in ensuring the effectiveness and functionality of conversational UI systems."
75,"The document discusses the evaluation of speech recognition technology, specifically in the context of transcribing spoken words to text. This involves comparing the output of the technology to transcripts created by human transcribers. Additionally, diarization is used to indicate when each participant speaks, and speaker attribution is used to associate the transcribed words with a specific speaker. These methods are important for evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of speech recognition technology."
76,"The document discusses common system metrics used to evaluate the performance of a system. Objective metrics are calculated from user interactions with the system, such as the duration of a conversation or number of turns. Subjective metrics, on the other hand, gather user opinions on quality aspects, such as the intelligibility of synthesized speech. These metrics are important for assessing the effectiveness and user satisfaction of a system."
77,"The common task-related metrics include time-to-task, correct transfer rate, containment rate, and abandonment rate. Time-to-task measures the time it takes to start a task after receiving instructions from the system. Correct transfer rate indicates the percentage of calls that are successfully directed to a human agent. Containment rate shows the percentage of calls that are handled by the system without being transferred to a human agent. Abandonment rate measures the percentage of callers who hang up before completing a task with the automated system. These metrics are important for evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of a system."
78,"The subjective evaluation of a chatbot involves gathering user opinions through questionnaires. The SASSI questionnaire, which includes 34 statements related to 6 factors, is commonly used for this purpose. These factors include system response accuracy, likeability, cognitive demand, annoyance, habitability, and speed."
79,"The SASSI (System for Analyzing and Scoring System Interfaces) statements are used to evaluate user experience with a system. These statements cover key aspects such as system response accuracy, cognitive demand, likeability, speed, annoyance, and habitability. System response accuracy refers to how well the system performs its intended function. Cognitive demand measures the mental effort required to use the system. Likeability reflects the user's attitude towards the system. Speed refers to the system's efficiency in completing tasks. Annoyance measures the level of frustration or irritation experienced by the user. Habitability considers the overall comfort and usability of the system. These statements can help identify areas for improvement in a system's design and functionality."
80,"This page discusses the importance of specific performance analytics for monitoring and evaluating the performance of a bot. These measures include user metrics such as the total number of users, active users who view content within a specific time frame, engaged users who interact with the bot, and new users needed to maintain an active user base. These metrics are essential for understanding the success of the bot and making necessary improvements."
81,"tracks the interactions between users and the bot, including the number of messages sent by the bot, users, and total conversations. It also measures the success of conversations by tracking new conversations and those initiated by inexperienced or returning users on different topics. The metrics provide insight into how individuals are interacting with the bot and can help identify areas for improvement."
82,"measures the effectiveness of a bot in completing its task, including retention rate, goal completion rate, goal completion time/messages/taps, fallback rate, and user satisfaction. These metrics help evaluate the performance of the bot and identify areas for improvement. A high retention rate and goal completion rate, as well as a low goal completion time/messages/taps and fallback rate, indicate a successful bot. User satisfaction can also be measured through exit surveys. 

Bot Metrics is a way to measure the success of a bot in completing its task. It includes metrics such as retention rate, goal completion rate, goal completion time/messages/taps, fallback rate, and user satisfaction. These metrics help assess the bot's performance and identify areas for improvement. A high retention and goal"
83,"The document discusses metrics for evaluating end-to-end neural conversational agents, which are designed to handle a wide range of topics. The main focus is on the naturalness of conversation. The primary metric for human evaluation is the Sensibleness and Specificity Average (SSA), which was proposed by Google. This metric uses common sense to determine if a response is reasonable and specific in the given context. It is calculated by taking the average of the sensibleness score (percentage of sensible responses) and the specificity score (percentage of specific responses). Other criteria for evaluation include interestingness and factuality. These evaluations are typically done through crowd-sourcing."
84,"The Chatbot Arena is a platform for evaluating large language models (LLMs) through anonymous, randomized battles. Users can ask questions to two anonymous chatbots and vote for the best response. The platform emphasizes fair play, as votes will not count if the AI identity is revealed."
85,"Automatic metrics, such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, are commonly used to evaluate the performance of machine-generated responses in natural language processing. However, these metrics do not always align with human judgments. Another metric, perplexity, measures the uncertainty of a language model and is found to have a strong correlation with human scores. This was discovered by the developers of Meena, a conversational agent developed by Google. The lower the perplexity, the more confident the model is in generating the next token, making it a useful tool for evaluating language models."
86,"LLM (Language Model) can be used as a tool for judging the correctness of output and adherence to specific criteria. This can be achieved by capturing human grading rules into an LLM prompt, which can also help ensure accurate performance and enable few-shot learning. Regression testing is important to measure the chatbot's performance across experiments or over time. To build a good test set, it is recommended to manually curate examples, add cases from application logs, and create synthetic data to simulate various scenarios and edge cases."
87,"The document provides various resources for creating and testing conversational agents, such as Google's Conversation Design for Actions on the Google Assistant and Gartner's reports on virtual customer assistants and conversational platforms. It also includes a guide to testing LLM applications and an article on creating a conversational agent that can chat about anything. Additionally, there is a guide to tool calling in LLMs by Sunil Kumar."
