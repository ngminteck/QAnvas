Page 18,NLP and intent matching are often tightly integrated in applications . rewriting and tagging the semantic entities in the input can improve intent matching accuracy . realtime unsupervised learning is prone to potential attacks .
Page 19,"large systems need to group intents for scalability . user may modify an intent along the way, or bring in another intent before the existing one is handled ."
