Emotion can also affect prosody, with angry and happy speeches having different patterns. Additionally, phrase breaks within a sentence are considered part of prosody."
23,"The document discusses the fundamental frequency (pitch) of speech signals, which is produced when the vocal cords vibrate. Voiced signals are periodic and unvoiced signals are noise. All vowels are voiced, while sounds like /s/ and /f/ are unvoiced. Pitch is a characteristic of voice signals only and can be measured as the duration between two pitch marks. It is calculated as 1/period."
24,"The fundamental frequency, also known as pitch or FO, is a crucial aspect of speech perception and generation. It is represented by the number of vibrations per second and is measured in Hertz (Hz).

Understanding and utilizing pitch is essential in achieving digital excellence in speech technology."
25,"The document discusses three common speech preprocessing techniques used in SINUS: voice activity detection (VAD), speech enhancement, and speech normalization. VAD is used to detect when speech is present and only starts processing when voice is detected. Speech enhancement is used to improve speech quality by reducing noise. Speech normalization is used to convert the speech signal to maintain consistency, through time and frequency domain normalization. These techniques are important for improving the accuracy and effectiveness of speech recognition systems."
