1,"The Graduate Certificate in Practical Language Processing is a practice module offered by the National University of Singapore's Institute of Systems Science. It is part of the MTech full-time program and is led by Dr. Fan Zhenzhen, Dr. Wang Aobo, and Dr. Gary Leung. The course focuses on practical skills and techniques for processing language, and is designed for professionals in the field of language processing. It is a one-year program and is open to individuals with a bachelor's degree in computer science or a related field."
2,"The document outlines the lecturers for the Practical Language Processing graduate certificate program at the National University of Singapore. The program is designed for students with a background in computer science or linguistics, and will be taught by Dr. FAN Zhenzhen, Dr. WANG Aobo, and Dr. Gary LEUNG. These experienced lecturers will provide students with the necessary skills and knowledge to work in the field of language processing."
3,"The Graduate Certificate in Practical Language Processing offered by the National University of Singapore focuses on developing skills in pre-processing textual data, categorizing documents, extracting information, and using deep neural networks for text mining tasks. The program consists of four modules, covering topics such as sentiment analysis, chatbots, and conversational UIs. By the end of the program, students will be able to build various language processing systems to support business decisions."
4,"The Grad Cert in Practical Language Processing program offered by the National University of Singapore will tentatively have an exam on May 19, 2025 from 6:30-10:00pm. The course dates for each module are as follows: TA (IS) from Feb 10-12, 2025, NMSM from Feb 17-19, 2025, TPML from Feb 24-27, 2025, CNI from Mar 03-06, 2025, and the Practice Module from Feb 17 - May 13, 2025. All rights reserved."
5,"The assessment for the Practical Language Processing Certificate includes an open book exam worth 50% of the grade, covering all topics taught in the four courses. The remaining 50% is based on a team-based project, where students must design, build, and evaluate a language processing system using public domain or sponsored data. The project should address a real business problem proposed by the students and approved by the lecturers, and must be completed by a team of 3 to 5 members."
6,"The Practice Module for the Grad Cert in Practical Language Processing requires students to complete a project that solves a business problem using language data, such as text or speech. The project must include a sentiment mining component or a conversational user interface. Additionally, the project should involve at least two text mining tasks, with one task utilizing a self-built deep neural network. Bonus points may be awarded for using self-collected data, addressing a novel problem, or implementing an innovative solution. Students are expected to work in teams of 3-5 people."
7,The Practice Module for the Grad Cert in Practical Language Processing requires students to include a section in their report about the use of ChatGPT or other similar instructional LLMs. Students must declare if they used an LLM like ChatGPT in their project and describe its role and tasks performed. They are also expected to discuss the pros and cons of using this LLM in their project.
8,"The document outlines the deliverables and deadlines for the Grad Cert in Practical Language Processing program at the National University of Singapore. The project proposal is due on February 28, 2025 and will be assessed through a recorded presentation and slides. The system, source codes, and datasets must be submitted by May 13, 2025, along with a report of less than 20 pages describing the business problem, datasets used, solution approaches, test results, conclusions, and references. In-class assessments, an individual report on contribution to the project, and peer review are also due on May 13, 2025 and make up 10% of the final grade."
9,"The proposal for the Graduate Certificate in Practical Language Processing should include a project title, project members' names, an overview of the business problem to be solved, and a detailed description of the components that will be used. The scope of work should focus on identifying available real-life data, outlining the process for executing the solution, and selecting appropriate techniques for each component. The proposal should also address any major omissions and explain how the project scope will demonstrate mastery of the course modules."
