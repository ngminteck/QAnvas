Page 5,an opinion consists of a sentiment (positive or negative) and a target (of opinion). Detect subjective opinion and determine its polarity is often the first step in sentiment mining.
Page 6,"2024 National University of Singapore. All rights reserved. Page 6 Definition of Opinion • Recall that opinion is formally defined as a quadruple (g, s, h, t)"

Page 10,the methods and features used for recognizing entities and aspects are usually different due to their individual specific characteristics . => often leverage on syntactic structures to discover opinion and target relationships .

Page 12,2024 National University of Singapore. All rights reserved. Page 12 Entity Extraction • Similar to the classic problem of Named Entity Recognition (NER) in NLP .
Page 13,"in traditional NER, the objective is to recognize all named entities of certain types in a corpus . the interest is often to find the mentions of a set of desired entities, e.g. the company’s"

Page 16,"keyword search is often applied first to retrieve relevant posts . it’s better to have a clear mining objective, from which you’ll derive a comprehensive list of name variations ."
Page 17,"in sentiment analysis applications involving consumer products, the entities are products, which typically have brands and models, forming a hierarchical relationship ."
Page 18,"a mention refers to some known entity, or none . but instead of PER(person), ORG(organization), GPE(geopolitical entity), UNK(unknown), we are typically looking for"
Page 19,"semi-supervised approaches try to tap on unlabeled examples; e.g. PU learning, Bayesian sets . identify all entities of the same type as the seeds from a given corpus ."
Page 20,PU Learning aims to identify entities of phones and a corpus . use sequences of specific POS tags to identify candidates .
Page 21,"the opinion holder is usually the author of the review, blog, post, etc. it’s trivial when the ID and date/time of the post are usually known ."

Page 28,a simplified version of Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI) can be used to compute co-occurrence strength . phrases that often co-occur with such part-of relation indicators are likely to be correct aspects .
