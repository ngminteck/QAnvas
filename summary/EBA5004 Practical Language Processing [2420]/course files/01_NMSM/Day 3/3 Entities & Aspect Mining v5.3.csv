Page 2, Module Objectives: Identify common tasks in aspect-based sentiment analysis . Extract key entities and aspects from opinions for closer analysis of sentiments . Use common and LM-based approaches to perform entity/aspect extraction .
Page 3, Researchers from the National University of Singapore have developed a framework for analysing an entity and its aspects in ABSA . The aim of the project is to extract the knowledge of an entity in a new way of extracting its aspects .
Page 4, The 2024 National University of Singapore was founded by the National Singapore Institute of Science and Technology . It is the first time the university has been awarded a university in Singapore's history .
Page 5," An opinion consists of a sentiment (positive or negative) and a target (of opinion) The opinion target is an entity, or its aspects, which can be an  entity or its aspect . Crucial for applications like product review"
Page 6," Opinion is formally defined as a quadruple (g, s, h, t), where g is the sentiment target, s is the opinion holder (the person or organization who holds the opinion) and t is the time when the opinion"
Page 7, It is called opinion target Extraction . Identifying them from text data is known as opinion target . It is a form of information extracted from text messages .
Page 8," ABSA tasks include identifying subjective/opinionated sentences, group entity/aspect synonyms and produce an aspect-based opinion summary of multiple  reviews ."
Page 9, ABSA subtasks are subtitled to the ABSA program . ABSA is an acronym for the National University of Singapore's ABSA programme .
Page 10, The methods and features used for recognizing aspects and aspects are usually different due to  specific characteristics . An opinion always has a target. The target is an aspect or an entity. It’s usually a noun or noun phrase (but

Page 15, The National University of Singapore has published a guidebook on how to use the world's most complex web-based corpora systems .
Page 16," In a large corpus, keyword search is often applied  first to retrieve relevant posts, using name variations of the desired entities ."
Page 17," In sentiment analysis applications involving consumer  products, the entities are products, which typically have                 brands and models, forming a hierarchical relationship . e.g. Apple – iPhone – iPhone Pro 14: 'Brand – product – model"
Page 18," Supervised Entity Linking aims to identify if a mention refers to some known entity, or none . Instead of PER(person), ORG(organization), GPE(geopolitical entity), we are typically looking for products,"

Page 35, The linguist uses syntactic relations between sentiment and their sentiment or opinion . E.g. X of Y: “the voice quality of the iPhone” – Genitives: ‘the camera’s price’
Page 36, Synthetic opinion-target relations can be used for simultaneous extraction of both sentiment words and opinion targets . E.g. “The software is  amazing.” -> pattern “NN – nsubj –JJ”
Page 37," An adjectival modifier of an NP is any adjectival phrase that serves to modify the meaning of the NP . E.g. I like this amazing software. - ""I"" is the nominal subject of ""like"""
