1,"The document discusses entity and aspect mining, a process used in sentiment mining to identify and analyze entities and their associated aspects in text data. It is a key component of the EBA5004 PLP course on new media and sentiment mining, taught by Dr. Fan Zhenzhen at the National University of Singapore. The document is copyrighted by the university and all rights are reserved."
2,This module aims to equip readers with the ability to identify tasks in aspect-based sentiment analysis and extract key entities and aspects from opinions for further analysis. It also covers common and LM-based approaches for performing entity and aspect extraction.
3,"The document discusses the concept of opinion targets, which are entities and their aspects that are the focus of sentiment analysis in ABSA. It outlines the different tasks involved in ABSA and the various approaches used for entity and aspect extraction, including frequency-based, lexical-syntactic, supervised-learning, deep-learning, and zero-shot approaches. The document is copyrighted by the National University of Singapore."
4,"The document discusses the importance of entities and aspects in aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Entities refer to the objects or concepts being evaluated, while aspects are the specific features or characteristics of these entities that are being analyzed for sentiment. ABSA involves identifying these entities and aspects from text data and then determining the sentiment associated with each aspect. This process is crucial for accurately understanding the sentiment expressed towards different entities and their aspects. Additionally, the document mentions the challenges in identifying entities and aspects, such as ambiguity and inconsistency in language use. It also highlights the potential benefits of ABSA, including improved product/service development and customer satisfaction."
5,"This page discusses the concept of opinion targets and their aspects in sentiment mining. An opinion is made up of a sentiment and a target, and detecting and determining its polarity is an important step in sentiment mining. However, to fully understand what people like or dislike, a finer-grained analysis is needed, which involves identifying the opinion target, which can be an entity or its aspects. This is crucial for applications such as product review analysis."
6,"The document defines opinion as a quadruple consisting of a sentiment target, sentiment, opinion holder, and time. In entity and aspect mining, there is an extra dimension of aspect/feature, resulting in a quintuple with entity and aspect representing the opinion target."
7,"Opinion target extraction involves identifying entities and aspects from text data, such as product names, services, individuals, events, and organizations. This task falls under the category of Information Extraction (IE) and is important for understanding opinions and sentiments expressed in text. An example of this is identifying the specific product or aspect that a person is expressing their opinion about, such as the service or battery life of a restaurant or iPhone."
8,"The typical tasks for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) involve identifying subjective sentences, extracting entities and aspects that have been commented on, determining the sentiment of the opinions, grouping synonyms for entities and aspects, and producing a summary of opinions from multiple reviews. These tasks are important for understanding and analyzing customer opinions and feedback."
9,"The ABSA (Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis) subtasks involve identifying and extracting entities and aspects from text, as well as determining the sentiment associated with each aspect. Entities refer to specific objects or concepts mentioned in the text, while aspects are the specific features or attributes of those entities. These subtasks are important for understanding the opinions and sentiments expressed in text and can be used for tasks such as product reviews and customer feedback analysis."
10,"The methods and features used for recognizing entities and aspects are typically different due to their unique characteristics. The main idea is that every opinion has a target, which can be an aspect or an entity. This target is usually a noun or noun phrase, but not always. Therefore, syntactic structures are often used to identify the relationship between opinions and targets."
11,"and Aspect Mining


The document discusses entity extraction and aspect mining, which are techniques used in natural language processing to identify and extract important information from text. Entity extraction involves identifying and categorizing named entities, such as people, organizations, and locations, while aspect mining involves identifying and analyzing the different aspects or features of a particular entity. These techniques are important for tasks such as sentiment analysis and information retrieval. The document also mentions the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for more accurate and efficient entity extraction and aspect mining."
12,"Entity extraction is a problem similar to Named Entity Recognition (NER) in natural language processing (NLP). There are three main approaches to entity extraction: rule-based, supervised statistical machine learning, and semi-supervised methods. Mature tools exist for NER, but not for entity extraction. In sentiment analysis, entities may need to be grouped into synonyms for accurate analysis."
13,"The main difference between traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) and sentiment mining is that while NER aims to identify all named entities of certain types in a corpus, sentiment mining focuses on finding mentions of specific entities, such as a company's own products or its competitors' products. This is achieved through two steps: identifying all mentions of the desired entities and then determining which entity each mention belongs to through entity linking or disambiguation/resolution."
14,"The document discusses entity resolution, which involves dealing with two common name ambiguity problems: polysemy and synonymy. Polysemy refers to words with multiple meanings, such as ""Apple"" which could refer to the company or a newspaper. Synonymy refers to different ways of referring to the same entity, such as ""National University of Singapore"" and ""NUS"". The goal of entity resolution is to cluster mentions of entities and map them to the correct target entities."
15,"The document discusses the scope of entities in different types of text data. Entity-focused corpora, such as online reviews, provide entity information through meta-data, but mentions of other entities may need to be identified for comparison in opinion mining. Domain-focused corpora, such as forum discussions, typically focus on a specific type of product or topic and require entity extraction and linking. Open domain corpora, like Twitter, can contain documents about any entity or topic with little or no meta-data, making entity extraction and linking the most challenging."
16,"The document discusses the use of keyword search in a large corpus, particularly on social media platforms like Twitter. It emphasizes the importance of having a clear mining objective and creating a comprehensive list of name variations to search for in order to retrieve relevant posts. However, due to polysemy (multiple meanings for a single word), a filtering step may be necessary to ensure that the retrieved posts truly contain the desired entities."
17,", the sentiment polarity at the brand level can be derived

The complexity in sentiment analysis for consumer products lies in the hierarchical relationship between entities such as brands and models. For example, the brand Apple has models such as the iPhone and iPhone Pro. By separating brands and models, sentiment polarity at the brand level can be determined. This is important in understanding overall sentiment towards a particular brand."
18,"The document discusses the process of supervised entity linking, which involves identifying whether a mention in text refers to a known entity or not. Instead of the traditional categories of person, organization, and geopolitical entity, the focus is on identifying products, services, and brands. This process requires a set of desired entities with their types and disambiguating text, as well as entity expressions to be linked. A possible solution involves candidate generation using heuristic rules and candidate ranking or classification using features such as similarity of entity names, context, and type. The main challenges in this process are feature engineering and obtaining enough labeled examples."
19,"The document discusses semi-supervised extraction methods for identifying entities in a given corpus. While supervised methods such as HMM or CRF require labeled training data, semi-supervised approaches utilize unlabeled examples. This includes PU learning and Bayesian sets, which use a set of seed entity names to identify other entities of the same type in the corpus. The general idea is that if these entities appear in similar contexts, they are likely to be the same type."
20,"PU learning is a method used to identify entities, such as phones, from a given set of positive examples and a corpus. It involves finding candidate entities from the corpus using specific POS tags and creating a TF vector for each mention of a seed entity. This vector represents a positive example and uses the surrounding words context of the seed mention. A PU learning algorithm, such as S-EM, is then used to label the candidates and learn a classification model. This method has been compared to distributional similarity in entity set expansion."
21,"This section discusses the extraction of opinion holders and time from various types of data. In social media data, the opinion holder is usually the author of the post, making it easy to extract. However, for other data such as news articles, the opinion holder and time may need to be extracted from the text, using methods like Maximum Entropy modeling. This is particularly important for quoted text, where the opinion holder and time may not be explicitly stated."
22,"The process of aspect extraction involves identifying and extracting specific aspects or features from a given text or document. This can be done using various techniques such as rule-based, statistical, or machine learning approaches. The extracted aspects can then be used for tasks such as sentiment analysis, opinion mining, and topic modeling. However, aspect extraction can be challenging due to the complexity and ambiguity of natural language and the need for domain-specific knowledge."
23,"The document discusses various approaches to entity and aspect mining, including finding frequent nouns and noun phrases, utilizing syntactic relations, using traditional supervised learning, employing Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and implementing zero-shot IE with large language models. These methods can help extract entities and aspects from text data, providing valuable insights for natural language processing tasks."
24,"The frequency-based approach is a common method for aspect mining, which involves analyzing the frequency of words in a given text to identify important aspects. This approach is based on the assumption that aspects are frequently mentioned in a text and therefore have a higher frequency compared to other words. It involves using techniques such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and n-gram analysis to extract relevant aspects from a text. This approach has been used successfully in various applications, including sentiment analysis and opinion mining. However, it has limitations, such as being sensitive to noise and not capturing the semantic relationships between words. Therefore, it is important to combine this approach with other methods for more accurate aspect mining."
25,"The method of using frequencies to identify aspects in product reviews assumes that there are a sufficient number of reviews about the same product or similar products. It involves using a POS tagger to identify nouns and noun phrases, counting their occurrence frequencies, and keeping only the frequent ones above a certain threshold. This approach has been found to work well, as aspects are typically expressed as nouns and noun phrases, and the vocabulary used by reviewers tends to converge when discussing the same type of product. Infrequent terms are often irrelevant."
26,"The document discusses the use of entities and aspect mining in analyzing online reviews, specifically focusing on popular mentions from TripAdvisor. The goal is to identify the most frequently mentioned entities and aspects in reviews and use this information to improve customer satisfaction and business strategies. The process involves using natural language processing techniques to extract entities and aspects from reviews and then ranking them based on their frequency and sentiment. This can provide valuable insights for businesses to make data-driven decisions."
27,"Frequency-based aspect extraction is a simple and effective method for identifying important aspects of a product. It involves detecting collocations and using frequency as a key factor. This approach is also applicable to entity extraction. However, it may not be effective if the corpus contains a mix of very different products or if each product only has a few reviews."
28,"To improve precision in aspect mining, a simplified version of Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI) can be used to calculate the co-occurrence strength between noun phrases. Heuristics can then be applied to filter for phrases that are likely to be aspects of entities, such as those indicating part-of relations. For example, in camera reviews, phrases like ""of camera"", ""camera has"", and ""camera comes with"" can be used to find camera components through web search. The discovered phrases that frequently co-occur with these part-of relation indicators are likely to be correct aspects."
29,"The document discusses how to distinguish between components or parts and attributes. This can be achieved through morphological cues such as suffixes like ""-iness"" or ""-ity,"" or by using resources like WordNet. WordNet can also help identify synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms, meronyms, and holonyms for a given word, such as ""camera."""
30,"• Hypernyms (camera is-a x)

The concept of ""is-a"" relationships is important in entity and aspect mining. Hyponyms, or subtypes, are entities that are more specific than a given entity, while hypernyms, or supertypes, are entities that are more general. For example, a camera is a type of entity, while specific types of cameras such as digital cameras or film cameras are hyponyms of the camera entity. On the other hand, camera is a hypernym of digital cameras and film cameras. Understanding these relationships can help in identifying and categorizing entities and aspects in text."
31,"The document discusses the is-a relation, specifically hypernyms, which describe a hierarchical relationship between entities. For example, a camera is-a device or object. This relation is useful for aspect mining, as it helps identify the general category of an entity, which can then be used to extract relevant aspects."
32,"The concept of a ""part-of"" relation is discussed, specifically in relation to meronyms, which describe the relationship between two entities where one is a part of the other. This is commonly seen in language processing tasks, such as identifying that a camera is made up of different parts, such as a lens and a body. This type of relation is important in aspect mining, as it helps to identify the components or aspects of a larger entity."
33,"The document discusses various methods for refining entity and aspect mining. These methods include filtering by dropping aspects with insufficient mentions, collapsing aspects at the word stem level, using pattern-based filters to remove non-aspect expressions, comparing frequencies of candidates in review and generic corpora, and using information distance to find related words. These methods aim to improve the accuracy of identifying true aspects."
34,"Page 34 discusses lexico-syntactic approaches in the context of entity and aspect mining. These approaches use linguistic patterns and syntactic structures to identify entities and aspects in text. They can be applied to different languages and domains, and have been shown to be effective in extracting relevant information from large datasets. However, these approaches may struggle with complex or ambiguous language, and may require manual annotation or refinement. Overall, lexico-syntactic approaches are a useful tool for entity and aspect mining, but may need to be combined with other techniques for optimal results."
35,"The document discusses the use of syntactic relations and linguistic patterns to identify sentiment expressions and their corresponding targets. This requires a parser to analyze the sentence structure. Examples of syntactic relations include the use of adjectives to describe a target, such as ""great photos"" or ""great picture quality and battery life."" Linguistic patterns, such as ""X of Y"" and genitives, can also be used to identify aspect-entity relations, such as ""the voice quality of the iPhone"" or ""the camera's price."""
36,"The document discusses using a dependency parser to identify reliable dependency relation templates from labelled training data, which can then be applied to find valid aspect-sentiment pairs in test data. This method, known as Double Propagation, allows for the simultaneous extraction of both sentiment words and opinion targets. An example of a pattern used in this method is ""NN - nsubj - JJ"", which would match a sentence like ""The software is amazing."" The Stanford Parser is recommended for this task."
37,"Dependencies are binary relations that show grammatical relationships between a governor (or head) and a dependent. For example, the dependency amod (adjectival modifier) indicates that an adjectival phrase modifies the meaning of a noun phrase. In the sentence ""I like this amazing software,"" the dependencies include nsubj (nominal subject), dobj (direct object), det (determiner), and amod (adjectival modifier). These dependencies show that ""I"" is the subject of ""like,"" ""software"" is the object of ""like,"" ""this"" is the determiner of ""software,"" and ""amazing"" modifies ""software."""
38,"(UD) is a framework for consistent annotation of grammatical categories in human languages

The Universal Dependencies (UD) framework is a standardized method for annotating grammatical categories in different human languages. It provides a consistent approach that can be used across languages, allowing for easier comparison and analysis of linguistic data. This framework is developed by the National University of Singapore and is constantly updated to reflect the evolving nature of languages."
39,"• nn – noun compound modifier

The document discusses Stanford Typed Dependencies, which are a way of representing the grammatical structure of a sentence. These dependencies include modifiers and compound modifiers, which provide additional information about nouns. Modifiers are words that change the meaning of the noun they are attached to, while compound modifiers are a combination of two or more words that act as a single modifier. These dependencies are useful for understanding the relationships between words in a sentence."
40,"of a predicate, including subjects, objects, and complements • nsubj - nominal subject, usually the grammatical subject of a verb


The Stanford Typed Dependencies system categorizes the arguments of a predicate, such as subjects, objects, and complements. One specific category is nsubj, which refers to the nominal subject and is typically the grammatical subject of a verb. This system is used to analyze and identify relationships between words in a sentence."
41,"The document discusses common dependency relations in sentiment analysis, specifically those between sentiment words and aspects, as well as those between sentiment words or aspects themselves. These include amod, prep, nsubj, csubj, xsubj, dobj, iobj, and conj. Examples are given, such as ""The phone has a nice screen"" and ""I like the color of the phone."" These relations are important in understanding the sentiment expressed towards different aspects of a product or service."
42,"This page provides example rules for extracting aspect and opinion words from text. These rules include identifying words that indicate aspects or opinions, such as adjectives and adverbs, and using context to determine the target entity. The rules also consider negation and intensifiers to accurately capture the sentiment expressed. These rules can be used in entity and aspect mining to identify relevant aspects and opinions in text data."
43,"The document discusses the use of genitive constructions in expressing part-of and attribute-of relations, using examples such as ""the battery of the iPhone"" and ""the iPhone's sound quality."" However, it notes that the semantic relations of the two nouns can vary depending on the context, such as possession, kinship, and source-from. In sentiment analysis, it is important to identify the specific entity being modified in order to determine its aspect."
44,"The document discusses an approach to aspect mining that does not use a full parser, which can be expensive and does not work well on informal data. Instead, the approach approximates dependency using distance and extracts aspects based on the nearest noun or noun phrase to a sentiment word. This is done using linear patterns of words and POS tags or chunk patterns from shallow parsing, and a pattern matching algorithm is used for extraction. This approach has been found to be very useful in practice."
45,"The document discusses the process of ranking candidates for aspect mining, which involves determining the likelihood of an aspect being genuine and its frequency. Multiple sentiment words and lexico-syntactic patterns are used to assess aspect relevance, while frequent aspects are ranked higher based on their frequency. The final ranking score is calculated by multiplying the aspect relevance by the logarithm of its frequency."
46,"_verb: use

The document discusses ways to further enhance entity and aspect mining, including using a phrase dependency parser to extract noun and verb phrases, adding comparative and superlative-based relations, and incorporating sentiment composition rules. It also mentions the inclusion of resource usage aspects, such as identifying resource expressions and usage verbs in relation to quantifiers and resource nouns. An example of this is identifying the usage of water in a sentence such as ""This washer uses a lot of water."""
47,"The document discusses the concept of implicit aspects in aspect mining, which are opinion expressions that do not explicitly mention an aspect as a noun. These can be mapped to aspects through a corpus-based approach, which looks at the co-occurrence of sentiment words and explicit mentions, or through a dictionary-based approach, which uses the definition of the word to determine the aspect. Examples of implicit aspects include price, appearance, and size."
48,"The process of grouping aspect expressions into categories is necessary because people use different words or phrases to describe the same aspect or aspect category, such as ""sound quality"" and ""voice quality."" However, this task is challenging as it is subjective and different applications or users may require different categories based on their needs or the level of analysis. While WordNet or other thesauri can be used to find synonyms, they may not be sufficient due to domain-specific synonyms, multi-word phrases not included in dictionaries, and words that are not true synonyms, such as ""expensive"" and ""cheap."""
49,"This page discusses various methods for aspect mining, which involves identifying and categorizing specific aspects or features of a given entity. These methods include identifying aspect expressions that share common words, such as ""battery life"" and ""battery power,"" as well as synonyms in dictionaries, such as ""movie"" and ""film."" Other methods involve measuring short lexical distances between aspect terms using WordNet, mapping aspect expressions to existing taxonomy nodes based on similarity, and using topic modelling (LDA). There are also other semi-supervised methods available for aspect mining."
50,"Page 50 discusses traditional supervised learning approaches, which involve training a model with labeled data and then using it to make predictions on new data. This method requires a large amount of labeled data and can be limited by the quality and representativeness of the data. It also does not account for new or changing concepts, making it less flexible. Additionally, traditional supervised learning approaches may struggle with complex or unstructured data, and may not be suitable for tasks such as entity and aspect mining."
51,"Supervised learning is a common approach for aspect extraction, treating it as a special information extraction problem. The dominant method is sequential learning or sequence labeling using models like hidden Markov models (HMMs) and conditional random fields (CRF). Other methods, such as sequential rules and tree-structured classification, have also been explored. However, this approach requires labelled data for training."
52,"This page discusses sequence labeling, a technique used in natural language processing to identify and classify entities within a text. It provides an example of how this technique can be applied to a sentence, using IOB/IO tags or similar tags to label each token according to its entity type. In this example, the sentence is labeled with POS (part of speech) and ASP (aspect) tags, indicating the parts of speech and aspects of the sentence."
53,"HMM is a directed sequence model that has been used successfully for sequence labeling tasks like NER and POS tagging. It operates under two main assumptions: the state only depends on its immediate predecessor (Markov Assumption) and the observation only depends on the current state. In the context of aspect extraction, the observations are words or phrases in a review, while the underlying or hidden states are aspect or opinion expression tags."
54,"The HMM is a statistical model that calculates the joint probability of a state sequence and an observation sequence. It involves an initial state, state transition distribution, and observation distribution. The model can be learned by maximizing the observation probability, and can be applied by finding an optimal state sequence using the Viterbi algorithm."
55,"The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model that represents a system with hidden states and observable outcomes. In the context of weather, the hidden states are hot and cold weather, while the observations are the number of ice creams eaten on a given day (1, 2, or 3). The model includes transition probabilities between states and emission probabilities, which represent the likelihood of observing a particular outcome given a hidden state."
56,"The document discusses the concept of sequence probability, which involves computing the joint probability of an observation sequence and a hidden state sequence. This can be useful in various applications, such as aspect mining. The formula for calculating sequence probability is provided as an example."
57,The Viterbi decoding algorithm is used to find the most likely sequence of hidden states based on a given observation sequence. It is commonly used in the field of natural language processing and speech recognition. The algorithm calculates the probability of each possible state sequence and selects the one with the highest probability as the optimal sequence. This is done by using a dynamic programming approach and keeping track of the most probable state at each step.
58,"The exercise on page 58 involves computing the values for v3(1) and v3(2) using the previous slide as a reference. This involves calculating the values for two states at two time steps, v1(1) and v1(2), as well as v2(1) and v2(2). This exercise helps to demonstrate the process of computing vt(j) for different states and time steps."
59,"The Lexicalized HMM is a method used for text sequence tagging, which involves identifying appropriate tags for a given sequence of words and parts-of-speech. This method integrates features such as POS information into the HMM, allowing for more accurate tagging. The goal is to find the sequence of tags that has the highest conditional probability given the words and POS information."
60,"CRF is a probabilistic graphical model that is useful for sequence modeling. It considers dependencies between neighboring nodes and global context, making it easier to incorporate multiple features. However, it is slower in training compared to other models. It models the conditional probability of a hidden sequence given an observation sequence and can be used to label unknown observations by selecting the hidden sequence with the highest probability."
61,"The document discusses the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) in the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The output of the CRF is the EA tags, which indicate the beginning or part of an aspect, or anything outside of the aspect. These tags are determined by various features such as the word, its part-of-speech tag, and neighboring words with their respective tags. Feature engineering is necessary for this process. The example given shows the output of the CRF for a sentence about food, with the only aspect being the food itself."
62,"Recent advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements in entity and aspect mining tasks. These approaches use neural networks to automatically learn representations of words and phrases, which can then be used to identify entities and aspects in text. They also incorporate contextual information and can handle noisy and sparse data. Additionally, some deep learning models can jointly perform entity and aspect extraction, reducing the need for separate models. However, these approaches require large amounts of labeled data and can be computationally expensive. 

Recent developments in deep learning have greatly improved entity and aspect mining tasks by utilizing neural networks to learn word and phrase representations. These models can handle noisy and sparse data and incorporate contextual information. Some models can also perform entity and aspect extraction simultaneously, reducing the need for separate"
63,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are machine learning models inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. They are commonly used for sequence modelling in natural language processing (NLP) and include networks such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks, and Transformer Networks. DNNs have shown to outperform traditional machine learning models and can learn feature representation and extraction tasks without the need for feature engineering. However, they require a large amount of labelled data for training and are often considered black box models due to their lack of interpretability."
64,"The recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of neural network that learns through sequential dependence by using the hidden state from the previous step as input for the current step. However, RNNs have a limitation known as the vanishing gradient problem, which affects their ability to handle long-term dependencies often required in natural language processing (NLP)."
65,"Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that use gating mechanisms to control the flow of information. This includes an update gate and a reset gate, which help capture long-term dependencies by allowing relevant information to pass through hidden states. GRUs have fewer parameters than LSTM, making them faster to train."
66,"LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that addresses the problem of long-term dependencies. It uses a memory cell and gates (input, forget, and output) to selectively update and forget information, allowing for more precise modeling."
67,"The Transformer with Attention is a unique deep neural network architecture that consists of layers of encoders and decoders. It includes a special attention layer that enables each element in a sequence to attend to other elements, resulting in improved handling of long-term dependencies. This architecture was developed by the National University of Singapore and has been shown to be effective in various applications."
68,"In 2018, there were significant developments in the field of natural language processing (NLP). These included the introduction of Elmo, which uses contextualized word embeddings, and pre-trained models such as BERT, GPT, XLNet, T5, and BART. These models are trained on large amounts of text data, allowing them to capture context, syntax, and semantics. They can then be fine-tuned with smaller datasets to perform various NLP tasks, including sentiment mining."
69,"Google has developed a pre-training and fine-tuning method for language models (LMs) to perform sentiment analysis. The pre-training involves using BERT base, which has 12 transformer layers and 110M parameters, or BERT Large, which has 24 transformer layers and 340M parameters. The fine-tuning process is used for tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, spam filters, toxic comments, and Q&A. This approach utilizes transfer learning to improve the performance of LMs for sentiment analysis."
70,"The document discusses the task of sentence-level sentiment classification, which involves identifying the sentiment expressed in a sentence. This task is important for understanding the overall sentiment of a text and can be useful in various applications such as product reviews, social media analysis, and customer feedback analysis. The document also mentions the GLUE benchmark, which is a popular benchmark for evaluating the performance of sentence-level sentiment classification models. It provides a leaderboard with the top-performing models and their corresponding scores."
71,"The use of deep learning for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) often involves treating entity extraction as a sequence tagging task, utilizing LSTM-based models for token classification. Alternatively, pre-trained transformers can be fine-tuned for this task, leveraging the knowledge already present in the models. This allows the model to adapt to a specific domain and task, requiring only a small set of labeled data for the relevant domain and task. Auto-encoding models such as BERT are particularly effective for detecting entity boundaries in token classification."
72,"The article discusses a sequence-to-sequence approach for aspect-based sentiment analysis, using BART as a pre-trained model. This approach involves both encoder and decoder layers, and the pre-training task involves taking a masked or permuted sentence as input and returning the restored sentence. The model is able to generate a sequence of token indexes and class indexes for various ABSA tasks. This approach was developed by Yan, Hang, et al. and is explained in their paper ""A Unified Generative Framework for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis."""
73,"The ABSA (Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis) subtask involves identifying the aspects or features of a given entity and determining the sentiment associated with each aspect. This task is important for understanding the opinions and sentiments expressed towards a specific entity. The ABSA subtask can be further divided into three subtasks: aspect extraction, aspect sentiment classification, and aspect-level sentiment classification. Aspect extraction involves identifying the aspects or features of a given entity, while aspect sentiment classification involves determining the sentiment associated with each aspect. Aspect-level sentiment classification involves determining the overall sentiment towards the entity, taking into account the sentiments associated with each aspect. These subtasks are essential for accurately analyzing and understanding opinions and sentiments towards entities."
74,"The overall architecture for entities and aspect mining involves a source sequence and a target sequence. The source sequence is a sentence, and the target sequence is a specific aspect or entity being mentioned in the source sequence. In this example, the source sequence is ""the battery life is good"" and the target sequence is a specific phone model. The source sequence is also tagged with part-of-speech (POS) information to help identify relevant entities and aspects."
75,"The zero-shot approach is a recent development in entity and aspect mining that aims to address the limitations of traditional methods. It involves training a model on a large dataset of entities and aspects, and then using that model to identify new entities and aspects without needing any specific training data. This approach has shown promising results in accurately identifying entities and aspects in various domains, such as product reviews and social media. However, it also has its own challenges, such as the need for a large and diverse dataset for training and the potential bias in the model's predictions. Further research is needed to improve the effectiveness and reliability of the zero-shot approach."
76,"The concept of zero-shot aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) involves using large pre-trained language models without any training or fine-tuning to extract aspects and sentiments from text. This can be achieved through extraction by question answering, natural language inference, or prompt-based methods using instruction-tuned language models such as ChatGPT. This approach leverages the powerful natural language understanding capabilities of these models for ABSA tasks."
77,"The concept of extraction as question answering involves predicting the answer to a given question within a given context paragraph. This method can be applied to extract entities and aspect expressions. However, it is limited to only explicitly mentioned expressions and requires asking the right question."
78,"The article discusses the use of extractive question-answering (QA) in natural language processing. It explains that generic questions do not yield good results, but more specific questions can improve performance. However, it questions whether it is necessary to explicitly extract these expressions in order to achieve better results."
79,"The document discusses the use of natural language inference (NLI) to transform aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) into an NLI task. This involves determining if a premise, such as a product review, can entail a hypothesis, which includes the aspect and polarity of the review. Models trained for NLI, such as BERT+MNLI and BART+MNLI, can be used for this purpose. The task involves determining a yes or no answer to whether the premise entails the hypothesis."
80,"The document discusses three key aspects of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA): aspect extraction (AE), aspect sentiment classification (ASC), and end-to-end ABSA (E2E). It also mentions a new approach to ABSA called ""zero-shot"" ABSA, which uses natural language inference. The authors of this approach, Shu et al., have published a paper on it."
81,"Prompt-based approaches with LLMs involve using generative language models, such as ChatGPT, which have been trained to predict responses based on given instructions. A prompt is the user's input or instruction to the model, which guides and conditions the model's generation. This prompt may include context, desired response, and input. The quality and specificity of the prompt can significantly impact the model's response."
82,"methods and techniques can be used to identify and extract different aspects and entities from text data. These methods involve creating a list of prompts, or keywords, related to the desired aspects and entities, and then using these prompts to search and extract relevant information from the text. This approach can be applied to various tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and opinion mining.

Prompt engineering is a technique used to identify and extract aspects and entities from text data. This involves creating a list of prompts or keywords and using them to search and extract relevant information from the text.

83,"Inference for implicit aspects involves understanding the underlying meaning and implications of a statement or text. In this example, the statement ""The camera is expensive and doesn't fit in the pocket"" implies that the camera is not only expensive, but also not easily portable. This type of inference is important for understanding the full context and implications of a statement."
84,"The LLM (Latent Logical Model) approach is used to automatically extract aspect categories from text data. This approach involves first identifying entities in the text, then using a logical model to identify relationships between entities and aspects. The LLM is trained on a large dataset of text and aspect category pairs, and can accurately identify aspect categories in new text data. This method has been shown to outperform other aspect mining techniques and is useful for applications such as sentiment analysis and opinion mining. However, it requires a large amount of annotated training data and may not be suitable for all types of text data. 

The LLM approach uses a logical model to extract aspect categories from text data. It is trained on a large dataset and has been proven to"
85,"The document discusses the use of multi-turn question-answering (QA) prompts for complex tasks that cannot be solved with one-time prediction. This involves breaking the task into stages and instructing the model to predict responses step by step. This approach, known as chained information extraction, relies on task-specific templates and previously extracted information. An example of this is event classification followed by event argument extraction. This method has been used in the paper ""Zero-shot information extraction via chatting with chatgpt"" by Wei et al. (arXiv:[REDACTED_PHONE])."
86,"The document discusses multi-turn question-answering (QA) and its two stages: entity type and entity name identification. The first stage involves identifying the type of entity mentioned in the question, while the second stage focuses on identifying the specific entity name. This process is important for accurately answering complex questions that require multiple pieces of information."
87,"The document discusses multi-turn question-answering (QA) and its connection to identifying entities and relations. Stage I involves identifying entities mentioned in the question, while Stage II involves identifying the relations between these entities. This process is important for understanding complex questions and providing accurate answers. The document is copyrighted by the National University of Singapore."
88,The document discusses multi-turn question answering for event type and its arguments. Stage I involves identifying the event type and Stage II involves identifying the arguments for the event type. This process is important for understanding complex questions and providing accurate answers.
89,"The document provides several references for further reading on the topics of aspect and entity extraction, sentiment analysis, and opinion mining. These include chapters from books such as ""Sentiment Analysis: Mining Opinions, Sentiments, and Emotions"" and ""Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining"", as well as articles from journals such as ""Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval"". Additionally, the document includes links to resources such as the Stanford Typed Dependencies Manual and Universal Dependencies website."
90,"The document discusses the ABSA tutorials that were conducted during the workshop, which included the heuristic, supervised-learning, and zero-shot classification approaches. Participants were then given an exercise to apply ABSA on two restaurants from the restaurant review dataset, with a focus on data cleaning and selecting relevant aspect categories such as food quality, service, ambiance, price/value, cleanliness, location, and general. They were allowed to use any model or technique learned in class and were required to submit their findings in a pdf file."
