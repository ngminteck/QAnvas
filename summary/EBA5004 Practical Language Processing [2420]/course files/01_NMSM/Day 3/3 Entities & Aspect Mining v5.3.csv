Page 2,page 2 Module Objectives Identify common tasks in aspect-based sentiment analysis . extract key entities and aspects from opinions for closer analysis of sentiments . use common and LM-based approaches to perform entity/aspect extraction .

Page 5,an opinion consists of a sentiment (positive or negative) and a target (of opinion) a common follow-up question is : what exactly do people like or not like?
Page 6,"opinion is formally defined as a quadruple (g, s, h, t) where g is the sentiment of the opinion about the target g . in the case of entity and aspect mining,"
Page 7,Identifying them from text data is called opinion target extraction . information extraction (IE) tasks include identifying entities from text .
Page 8,"tasks include identifying subjective/opinionated sentences . determine whether the opinions are positive, negative or neutral . produce an aspect-based opinion summary of multiple reviews ."
Page 9,Page 9 ABSA subtasks: 2024 National University of Singapore. All rights reserved. Page 9 .
Page 10,the methods and features used for recognizing entities and aspects are usually different due to their individual specific characteristics . an opinion always has a target. – The target is an aspect or an entity .

Page 12,"Mature tools are available to perform NER (GATE, NLTK, Stanford NER, etc.), but not for entity extraction . for sentiment analysis, an additional step is usually needed to group the entities into synonyms"
Page 13,"in traditional NER, the objective is to recognize all named entities of certain types in a corpus . in sentiment mining, the interest is often to find the mentions of a set of desired entities, e.g."
Page 14,"the task is to cluster entity mentions, and map them to target entities . page 14 Entity resolution ."
Page 15,entity information can be obtained from meta-data . domain-focused corpora focusing on discussions of a specific type of products or topics . need to perform entity extraction and linking .
Page 16,"keyword search is often applied first to retrieve relevant posts . due to polysemy, a filtering step may be required to get posts that truly contain the desired entities ."
Page 17,"page 17 Another complexity . in sentiment analysis applications involving consumer products, the entities are products, which typically have brands and models forming a hierarchical relationship ."
Page 18,"instead of PER(person), ORG(organization), GPE(geopolitical entity), UNK(unknown), we are typically looking for products, services, and brands ."
Page 19,"supervised entity extraction using HMM or CRF is still applicable . but it requires labeling of training data, which may not always be possible . semi-supervised approaches try to tap on unlabeled examples ."
Page 20,"use a PU learning algorithm like S-EM (Liu et al., 2002) to learn a classification model to label the candidates ."
Page 21,"NER task is trivial when the ID and date/time of the post are usually known . for other data, like news articles, they may need to be extracted out of text ."

Page 27,the candidate aspects are almost always the most important aspects of the product . if the corpus has a mixture of very different products and/or has only one or two reviews .
Page 28,"use heuristics to filter for noun phrases that are more likely to be aspects of entities . for camera reviews, phrases indicating part-of relations can be used to find camera components by web search ."
