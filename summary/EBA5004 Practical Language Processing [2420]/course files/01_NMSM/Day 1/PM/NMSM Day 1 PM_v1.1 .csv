Page 13,0. Overview of Typical Sentiment Analysis System Step 1 Step 2 Step 4 Step 5 Step 3 Step 4 .
Page 14,the business objectives need to be clearly defined in any business analytics system . examples of typical business objectives include: 1. to reduce customer churn . 2. To anticipate stock market reactions based on public sentiments 3. To detect fake news
Page 15,"the next step is to identify the data source and type of text data . social media from media like WSJ, Reuters are usually well-structured and can be extracted relatively easily ."
Page 16,step 3: Identifying Training Corpora . two ways to improve quality of training corpora: 1. Having domain experts to perform data annotations . perform tasks such as Subjectivity Classification and Sarcasm Detect
Page 17,examples of supervised sentiment classification methods 1. Nave Bayes methodology 2. K Nearest Neighbour (kNN) Classification 3. Maximum Entropy Method 4. Support vector machine (SVM) 2. Syntactic

Page 20,Lexicon semi-supervised approach uses observations from words/ their patterns to construct rules for sentiment scores . most used in industry practice actually. Especially finance because of its flexibility .
Page 21,"compute the sentiment polarity of a target in a sentence by using sentiment aggregation . also consider sentiment shifters, but-clauses, and the syntactic relationships of sentiment expressions and opinion targets"
Page 22,"-ve terms: stinks, bad, old-fashioned, yuck!,... There are flaws – note due to the context . ""the bag is a little big for her"""
Page 23,"the Opinion Lexicon is a combination of manual, dictionary and corpus based approaches . knowing some sentiment words helps to find more . ""the dress is elegant and refined but provocative"" is one example ."
Page 24,"the phone’s call quality is not good [+1], but its battery life is long [+1] • Apply sentiment words and phrases ."
Page 25,"main steps: Mark sentiment words and phrases; apply sentiment rules (such as negation words) Aggregate opinions; Across sentences and time, weighing by its importance ."
Page 26,"auxiliary verbs (e.g., would, should, could, might, must, ought) may change sentiment orientation, but not always . ""the service could be improved."" ""it hardly works."" ""the car failed"
Page 27,"increased quantity of an opinionated item (NEG and POS, often nouns) can change its orientation . ""this drug reduced my pain significantly."" ""my pain disappeared after taking the drug."""
Page 28,"the camera memory went up a lot. ""the battery life is short."" ""Sony reduced the price of the camera."" POS NPI + no/low/less/decreased => POS 28 ."
Page 29,"if two sentiment words have the opposite polarity, the first adjective gets higher weight . if in two clauses connected by ""but"", the one after the connector is dominant ."
Page 30,"other rules: Consume resource and produce waste . ""after taking the drug, my blood pressure went up to 200"""
Page 31,Sentiment words in non-opinion contexts need to be careful with such words . Entity names containing sentiment words “best denki” and “fast forward” are a good example .
Page 32,"many sentiment words have multiple meanings or senses and they do not always express sentiment in all contexts . some express different sentiments in different context ""this car smells,"" ""this perfume smells good,"" ""This room has"
Page 33,Pros and cons of unsupervised training methods . supervised methods have shown to perform well in a large number of applications . Cons: heavy investment in time and effort to build the initial knowledge base .

Page 37,1. Training data for sentiment analysis 37
Page 38,"in generating training set, go for 'high-precision' and 'low recall' high precision means be sure those you say are positive are indeed positive . those that are negative are indeed negative . Normally happens"
Page 39,"the training data set is usually not static but requires fine- tuning even after production . this helps to account for changing fads in expressions, languages slangs etc as well ."
Page 40,w3.org/community/sentiment/wiki/Datasets iii. nltk corpus Then expand and modify the dictionary corpus .
Page 41,SentiWordnet adds on to WordNet by assigning sentiment polarity to these senses . the training corpus can be expanded using bootstrapping .
Page 42,the bootstrapping of wordnet synsets can be understood in 2 steps . use a seed set of positive and negative words with their sentiment .
Page 43,use the meta-data in social media to assign positive or negative ratings . use high ratings this as positive labels; and low ratings as negative labels .

Page 45,2. Features for sentiment analysis 45
Page 46,some common features used in sentiment analysis are: Part of speech (POS) tags (adjectives or nouns) Negations • Syntactic dependency (more about this on Day 3)
Page 47,Various ways (trial-and-error) to reduce the number of features used in the matrix . Remove features that appear rarely in the documents . Leverage on the labels to pick K most useful features .
Page 48,training data (corpus) selection/ generation ii. Features selection . features selection requires domain expertise . training data selection needs to be as similar as possible to production data .
Overall Summary,ML.NET and SentiWordNet will be presented at a conference in london on october 8 . the workshop will focus on the use of a supervised sentiment analysis system . it will also examine how to improve the quality of the training corpora .
