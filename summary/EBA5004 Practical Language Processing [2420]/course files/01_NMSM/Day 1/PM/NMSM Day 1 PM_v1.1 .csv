2,"The agenda for the day includes discussions on considerations for designing a sentiment analysis system, the use of a lexicon-based approach for sentiment mining, generating training data sets for sentiment mining, and using word embedding vectors as features for sentiment mining. These topics will cover important aspects of sentiment analysis system design and provide insights into feature engineering for effective sentiment mining."
3,"The document discusses the importance of cost and speed in data processing, using examples such as e-commerce reviews and social media monitoring. These tasks involve processing large amounts of data, with platforms like Amazon handling trillions of customer reviews daily and millions of social media posts per second. The document also highlights the need for model refreshment with newly collected data every day, and emphasizes the importance of lightweight and high-performance solutions."
4,"The document discusses domain-specific tuning, using the example of financial sentiment analysis. It mentions a specific model, FinBERT/AZFinText, which is trained on SEC filings, earnings reports, and analyst reviews and has been found to outperform general GPT-based sentiment analysis. This model is well-suited for structured financial news and investment reports and is easier to fine-tune and re-train."
5,"The agenda for the day includes discussions on the design of a sentiment analysis system, using a lexicon-based approach for sentiment mining, generating a training data set for sentiment mining, and feature engineering. The use of word embedding vectors as features will also be explored."
6,This section discusses the use of logistic regression for sentiment analysis and the importance of explainability in this process. It explains how SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) can be used to interpret the results of the logistic regression model and understand the impact of each feature on the sentiment prediction. The section also discusses the limitations of using logistic regression for sentiment analysis and suggests alternative approaches for better accuracy.
7,"The document discusses the concept of explainability in machine learning and how it can be achieved through the use of Permutation Feature Importance in ML.NET models. This method helps to identify the most important features that contribute to the model's predictions, allowing for better understanding and interpretation of the model's behavior. The document provides a step-by-step guide on how to implement this technique in ML.NET, as well as examples and explanations to further clarify its use."
8,The concept of explainable AI (XAI) is becoming increasingly important as AI systems are being used in various industries. XAI refers to the ability to understand and interpret the decisions made by AI models. Two popular methods for achieving XAI are LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). LIME provides explanations for individual predictions by approximating the model's behavior locally. SHAP uses game theory to assign importance values to features in a model. Both methods can help improve trust and transparency in AI decision-making.
9,"The agenda for the session includes discussing important factors to consider when designing a sentiment analysis system. The session will cover the use of a lexicon-based approach for sentiment mining, creating a training data set for sentiment analysis, and feature engineering techniques. Additionally, the session will explore the use of word embedding vectors as features in sentiment analysis."
10,"ms inference with TensorRT • TensorRT can optimize pre-trained models for faster inference on GPUs.

Real-time analysis is important for tasks such as customer support chat sentiment tracking. An example use case is a chatbot that needs to analyze user sentiment quickly. This can be achieved using a pre-trained sentiment model, which is more cost-effective than using a more advanced model like GPT. TensorRT is a tool that can optimize pre-trained models for faster inference on GPUs, achieving high-speed 10ms inference."
11,"The cost and speed of implementing a new network management system (NMS) are important considerations for any organization. The initial cost of purchasing and installing an NMS can be high, but the long-term benefits of improved efficiency and reduced downtime can outweigh this expense. Additionally, the speed at which the NMS can be implemented and integrated with existing systems is crucial to minimize disruption and ensure a smooth transition. Factors that can affect the speed of implementation include the complexity of the network, the level of customization required, and the availability of resources and expertise. Careful planning and consideration of these factors can help organizations successfully implement a new NMS."
12,"The agenda for this session includes discussions on important factors to consider when designing a sentiment analysis system, such as using a lexicon-based approach and creating a training data set. Feature engineering and incorporating word embedding vectors as features will also be explored."
13,"The typical sentiment analysis system consists of five main steps. The first step involves data collection and preprocessing, where relevant data is gathered and cleaned for analysis. The second step is feature extraction, where important features are identified from the data. The third step is sentiment classification, where the sentiment of the text is determined using various techniques such as machine learning algorithms. The fourth step is evaluation, where the accuracy of the sentiment analysis is measured. The final step is deployment, where the sentiment analysis system is implemented for use in real-world applications."
14,"The first step in implementing a business analytics system is to clearly define the business objectives. These objectives could include reducing customer churn by addressing key complaints, predicting stock market reactions based on public sentiments, identifying and reporting fake news, and understanding public sentiment towards a new public policy after consultations. It is important to have a clear understanding of these objectives in order to effectively utilize business analytics."
15,"The second step in text data analysis is to identify the source and type of text data. The pre-processing methods used will vary depending on the type of data, such as social media or news articles. Well-structured data from sources like WSJ and Reuters can be extracted more easily."
16,"Before training sentiment analysis models, it is important to have high-quality training corpora. This can be achieved by having domain experts perform data annotations or using a systematic data annotation scheme. Additionally, performing tasks like Subjectivity Classification and Sarcasm Detection can help ensure accurate computation of sentiment scores. This is crucial as the saying ""garbage in, garbage out"" applies to sentiment analysis as well."
17,"Step 4 of the NMSM process involves sentiment classification and scoring, which can be done at different levels such as document-level and sentence-level. Examples of supervised methods for sentiment classification include Naïve Bayes, kNN Classification, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machine. Unsupervised methods include using syntactic patterns and web search, as well as sentiment lexicons. Evaluating the performance of these models can be a challenge."
18,"Step 5 of the NMSM process involves identifying and defining key performance indicators (KPIs) that align with the business objectives of the system. KPIs are quantifiable measurements that demonstrate the value of the system and its return on investment (ROI). It is important to ensure that the insights gained from the system are actionable and effectively communicated to stakeholders through sentiment visualization, such as dashboards. This step helps to ensure that the resources invested in the system are justified and provide clear benefits to the business."
19,"The lexicon-based semi-supervised approach is a method for sentiment analysis that uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This approach involves creating a lexicon or dictionary of words associated with each sentiment category, and then using this lexicon to assign sentiment scores to words in the unlabeled data. These scores are then used to classify the text as positive, negative, or neutral. This approach is useful for situations where there is limited labeled data available, as it can still achieve accurate results by leveraging the large amount of unlabeled data. However, it also has limitations, such as the potential for bias in the lexicon and the need for continuous updating as language evolves."
20,"The Lexicon semi-supervised approach is a commonly used method in industry, particularly in finance, for sentiment analysis. It utilizes patterns and rules derived from words to determine sentiment scores, which are then aggregated for a more accurate analysis. This approach has been proven effective in the finance industry, as shown by a 2011 paper that sparked a trend in its use. Its overall effectiveness should not be underestimated."
21,"The lexicon-based approach for sentiment analysis involves using a sentiment lexicon, which includes words, phrases, and idioms, as well as composite expressions and rules for opinions. This method calculates the sentiment polarity of a target in a sentence by considering the distances between sentiment expressions and the target entity or aspect. It also takes into account sentiment shifters, but-clauses, and the syntactic relationships between sentiment expressions and opinion targets."
22,"The Lexicon semi-supervised approach involves using a predefined list of words, phrases, and expressions to determine sentiment. This includes both positive and negative terms, as well as phrases, slangs, and idioms. However, there may be flaws in this approach due to the context in which these terms are used. For example, a phrase like ""the bag is a little big for her"" may not accurately reflect the sentiment towards the bag, and a statement like ""that's pretty ugly"" may not convey a strong negative sentiment."
23,"The process of creating an opinion lexicon involves a combination of manual, dictionary, and corpus-based approaches. This includes manually inspecting words, using dictionaries such as WordNet and SenitWordNet, and considering context-dependent words and phrases. The process is iterative, and having knowledge of some sentiment words can help to identify more. For example, if ""elegant"" is considered positive, then ""refined"" would also be considered positive, while ""provocative"" would be considered negative."
24,"The document discusses the use of the Opinion Lexicon to evaluate sentiment in a sentence. In the example given, the sentiment words and phrases are marked, sentiment shifters are applied, and the but-clauses are handled. The overall sentiment for call quality is negative and for battery life is positive."
25,"The main steps of a simple method for sentiment analysis, as proposed by Ding, Liu, and Yu in 2008, involve identifying sentiment words and phrases, applying sentiment rules, handling but-clauses, and aggregating opinions across sentences and time. This method assumes that the target entities and aspects are known, and it takes into account the importance of opinions when weighing them."
26,"Sentiment rules involve identifying words or phrases that can change the sentiment or emotional tone of a statement. These include negation words like ""not"" or ""never,"" modal auxiliary verbs, adverbs like ""barely"" or ""hardly,"" and words that indicate failure or neglect. These words can either reverse the sentiment or shift it in a different direction. For example, ""The taste is not good"" would have a negative sentiment due to the use of ""not,"" while ""The service could be improved"" may have a neutral or slightly positive sentiment due to the use of the modal auxiliary verb ""could."" The formula for identifying sentiment changes is POS + shifter => NEG and NEG + shifter => POS."
27,"The sentiment of an opinionated item can be reversed or changed by decreasing or increasing its quantity. For example, saying ""this drug reduced my pain significantly"" has a positive sentiment, while saying ""my pain disappeared after taking the drug"" has a negative sentiment. Similarly, saying ""the earphone can isolate noise"" has a positive sentiment, but if the quantity is increased, it can intensify the positive sentiment, and if the quantity is decreased, it can intensify the negative sentiment."
28,"The sentiment composition rules determine the sentiment of a sentence based on the presence or absence of positive or negative items and the quantity or change in quantity of those items. For example, if a sentence contains a NegativePolarityItem (NPI) and a word indicating a decrease in quantity, the sentiment is considered negative. On the other hand, if the sentence contains a PositivePolarityItem (PPI) and a word indicating an increase in quantity, the sentiment is considered positive. These rules are used to analyze sentiment in sentences such as ""The camera memory went up a lot,"" ""The battery life is short,"" and ""Sony reduced the price of the camera."""
29,"Sentiment conflicts occur when multiple sentiment words with different polarities are used together in a sentence, such as ""terribly good"" or ""pretty ugly."" To resolve these conflicts, the constituents are ranked based on their relative weights or importance. For example, if two sentiment words have opposite polarities, the first adjective is given a higher weight. In cases of adverbs and adjectives, the verb polarity prevails, while in clauses connected by ""but,"" the sentiment in the clause after the connector is dominant."
30,"The document discusses other rules that can be applied in sentiment analysis, such as the intensification rule for a more detailed scale of sentiment, and the concept of resource consumption and waste production, such as in the example of a computer using a lot of electricity. It also suggests adding a rule for deviations from the norm or a desired value range, as seen in the examples of increased blood pressure after taking a drug and receiving a score of 45 out of 100."
31,"The document discusses the use of sentiment words in non-opinion contexts and the need to be cautious when using them. Examples of such contexts include entity names, function names, greetings, and author's self-description. The use of these words should be considered carefully to avoid any potential misunderstandings."
32,"Sentiment words can have different meanings or senses, and may not always express sentiment in every context. For example, the phrase ""great grandfather"" does not necessarily convey sentiment, while the sentences ""This is clearly a bad phone"" and ""Well, I do not think that this is a good car"" do express sentiment. Additionally, some sentiment words can express different sentiments in different contexts, such as ""smell"" in the sentences ""This car smells,"" ""This perfume smells good,"" and ""This room smells bad."" The specific context and usage of a sentiment word can greatly impact its sentiment."
33,"Unsupervised training methods have the advantage of being domain-independent and have shown good performance in various applications. They are also flexible and can be extended and improved easily. However, building the initial knowledge base of lexicon, patterns, and rules requires a heavy investment of time and effort. Additionally, unsupervised methods still struggle with handling domain differences, especially when it comes to sentiment expressions. On the other hand, supervised methods have the advantage of powerful learning of various features. However, they are dependent on manually labelled training data for each domain and models trained in one domain may not perform well in another domain."
34,"The supervised approach in machine learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where the correct output is already known. This allows the model to learn from the data and make predictions on new, unseen data. The process involves selecting a suitable algorithm, preparing the data, and evaluating the model's performance. The most commonly used algorithms in supervised learning are regression and classification. Supervised learning is useful for solving prediction and classification problems, and it requires a large amount of high-quality labeled data for optimal performance."
35,"The key points from page 35 of the document 'NMSM Day 1 PM_v1.1 .pdf' are that supervised classifier systems involve the generation of a training set, which is used to train the system. This training set is created through features engineering, which involves selecting and transforming data into meaningful features for the classifier to learn from. The training process is supervised, meaning that the system is given labeled data to learn from and improve its performance. This approach allows for more accurate and efficient classification results."
36,"The document discusses sentiment analysis classifiers, which are used to analyze and classify the sentiment or emotion expressed in text. Some classic algorithms used for this task include Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Max Entropy, and Support Vector Machine. Deep learning is also mentioned as a more advanced technique that will be covered in a future class."
37,"The document discusses the importance of training data in sentiment analysis, which involves analyzing emotions and opinions expressed in text. It explains that training data is essential for building accurate sentiment analysis models and provides examples of different types of training data, such as labeled datasets and lexicons. It also mentions the challenges of obtaining high-quality training data and suggests strategies for addressing these challenges, such as using crowdsourcing or domain-specific data. Additionally, the document emphasizes the importance of constantly updating and refining training data to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis models."
38,"by including both positive and negative examples.

The training data set should be as similar as possible to the test set in order to achieve accurate results in supervised training models. It is important to use data from the same domain to avoid issues with domain-specific terms. It is recommended to generate a training data set specifically for the objective at hand. When creating the training set, it is best to prioritize high precision, meaning that the positive and negative examples are accurately identified, even if this results in a lower recall, where some actual positives or negatives may be ignored. It is important to balance the dataset by including both positive and negative examples."
39,"The document discusses ways to create a training data set, including using a dictionary corpus, user-generated data, or manual inspection. It is important to continuously fine-tune the data set to account for changes in language and expressions."
40,"is provided, followed by a

The document discusses the use of dictionary corpora in natural language processing. It mentions some examples of existing dictionary corpora, such as SentWordNet and public sources like Liu Bing and nltk corpus. The importance of expanding and modifying these corpora is emphasized, with a primer on revising synsets provided."
41,"WordNet is a comprehensive database of English words that groups nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs into sets of related words called synsets. These synsets represent distinct concepts and can be used to expand a training corpus through bootstrapping. SentiWordnet builds upon WordNet by assigning sentiment polarity to these synsets. The workshop will cover more information on WordNet and SentiWordnet."
42,"Bootstrapping synsets involves two steps: using a set of positive and negative words with their sentiment as a starting point, and then iterating through each word to search for its corresponding synset. The synset will then inherit the sentiment of the original seed word."
43,User-generated ratings can be assigned to comment posts on social media by using the meta-data available. High ratings are considered positive labels and low ratings are considered negative labels.
44,"The document discusses the potential biases in user-generated ratings and the importance of being cautious when using them. It highlights the fact that reviews are often influenced by personal experiences and emotions, and may not accurately reflect the overall quality of a product or service. It also suggests using multiple sources and considering the credibility of the reviewer when evaluating ratings."
45,"Sentiment analysis is a technique used to analyze and understand the emotions and opinions expressed in text data. Some key features for sentiment analysis include identifying the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral), determining the subject or target of the sentiment, and detecting the intensity of the sentiment. Other important features include detecting sarcasm and irony, understanding the context of the sentiment, and handling linguistic variations and nuances in language. These features are essential for accurately analyzing and interpreting sentiment in text data."
46,"Feature engineering is an important aspect of sentiment analysis, and some common features used include part of speech tags, opinion lexicons and phrases, negations, syntactic dependency, sentiment-aware tokens, word vectors, and term frequency with different weighting schemes. It is recommended to thoroughly examine data sets in order to identify other relevant word features that may affect the polarity of statements in a project."
47,"Feature selection is a process of choosing relevant features and reducing the number of features used in a matrix. This can be done through trial-and-error methods such as removing rarely appearing features, selecting the top K most frequent features, or using labels to pick the K most useful features."
48,"The success of a sentiment analysis relies heavily on two key steps: selecting or generating appropriate training data (corpus) and choosing relevant features. These steps are often more important than the actual training algorithms used. The training data should closely resemble the production data, and the features should be selected based on domain expertise. These pre-steps are crucial for the success of a sentiment analysis."
