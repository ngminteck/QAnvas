Page 13,Typical Sentiment Analysis System Step 1 Step 2 Step 4 Step 5 Step 3 Step 3 . a sample of a sentiment analysis system .
Page 14,business objectives must be clearly defined in any business analytics system . example of typical business objectives include: 1. to reduce customer churn by focusing on their key complaints 2. to anticipate stock market reactions based on public sentiments 3. to
Page 15,"the pre-processing pipeline will depend on type of text data we are working with . social media from media like WSJ, Reuters are usually well-structured ."
Page 16,training corpora needs domain experts to perform data annotations . perform tasks such as Subjectivity Classification and Sarcasm Detection .
Page 17,Sentiment Classification and Scoring • Different levels of sentiment classification (e.g document-level and sentence- level)
Page 18,"key performance indicators (KPIs) refer to a set of quantifiable measurements used to gauge a business value of the system . the ROI to the business must be clear . for example, there must be actionable"
Page 19,Lexicon-based semi-supervised approach 19 . supervised approach based on a semi-guided approach .
Page 20,Lexicon semi-supervised approach . uses observations from words/ patterns to construct rules for sentiment scores . most used in industry practice actually .
Page 21,"Lexicon-based approach requires a sentiment lexicon (patterns - words, phrases, idioms), composite expression, rules of opinions . also consider sentiment shifters, but-cla"
Page 22,"-ve terms: stinks, bad, old-fashioned, yuck!,... . Idioms: ""soft hearted"", ""hard nosed"""
Page 23,"the process is iterative . knowing some sentiment words helps to find more . if “elegant” is +ve, then “refined” is –ve 23 ."
Page 24,"the phone’s call quality is not good, but its battery life is long . call quality – negative, battery life - positive 24 hours a day ."
Page 25,"assumption: target entities and aspects are known (as NER in a sentence, or a specific review) • Main steps (Ding, Liu and Yu, 2008):"
Page 26,"adverbs like barely, barely, hardly, ""the car failed to start"" POS + shifter => NEG => POS 26 ."
Page 27,"decreased (or removal, disappearance) and increased quantity of an opinionated item can change its orientation . POS + decreased => NEG NEG + increased => POS (intensification)"
Page 28,"the quantity or change of quantity of potential positive or negative items . ""the battery life is short,"" ""sony reduced the price of the camera"""
Page 29,"resolution is to rank constituents on the basis of relative weights . if two sentiment words have the opposite polarity, the one after the connector is dominant ."
Page 30,"intensification rule: ""extremely happy"" (for granular scale of sentiment) ""this computer uses a lot of electricity"""
Page 31,"Sentiment words in non-opinion contexts sometimes need to be careful with such words . Greetings and good wishes ""good morning"""
Page 32,"many sentiment words have multiple meanings or senses . some express different sentiments in different contexts, such as ""great grandfather"""
Page 33,"• Unsupervised • Pros: • Domain independence method performs well in a large number of applications . Flexible, can be easily extended and improved ."
Page 34,2. Supervised approach 34
Page 35,overview of supervised classifier system training set generation Features engineering Supervised training sets generation features engineering . a new generation of classifiers will be available in the u.s.

Page 37,1. Training data for sentiment analysis 37
Page 38,training data sets should be used from the same domain as far as possible . high-precision means be sure those you say are positive are indeed positive . low recall means a lot of the actual positives or actual negatives are
Page 39,"training data set is usually not static but requires fine- tuning even after production . this helps to account for changing fads in expressions, languages slangs etc ."
Page 40,"nltk corpus Then expand and modify the dictionary corpus . first, a revision over synsets (revision primer from Text Mining)"
Page 41,the training corpus can be expanded using bootstrapping . SentiWordnet adds sentiment polarity to these senses .
Page 42,the bootstrapping of wordnet synsets can be understood in 2 steps . use a seed set of positive and negative words with their sentiment .
Page 43,user-generated ratings 43: Use meta-data in social media to assign positive or negative ratings . use high ratings this as positive labels; low ratings as negative labels.
Page 44,user-generated ratings 44 • Mind the biased reviews . a biased review of users' ratings is based on a sexy review of the ratings .
Page 45,2. Features for sentiment analysis 45
Page 46,some common features used in sentiment analysis are: Part of speech (POS) tags (adjectives or nouns) and Negations . tf-idf What are other word features do you think will matter?
Page 47,to select relevant features and reduce the number of features used in the matrix . remove features that appear rarely in the documents .
Page 48,two key steps before building a sentiment analysis are: i. training data selection/ generation ii . features selection These pre-steps are key to the success of a . sentiment analysis and usually more important than the
