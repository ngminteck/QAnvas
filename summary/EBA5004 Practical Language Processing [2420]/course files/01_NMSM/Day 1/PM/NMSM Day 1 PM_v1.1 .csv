Page 13, The Typical Sentiment Analysis System is designed to help people understand their feelings in the social media world . The system is based on an image of a person with a negative view of the public .
Page 14," In any business analytics system, the business objectives need to be clearly defined . Examples of typical business objectives include: To reduce customer churn by focusing on their key complaints . To anticipate stock market reactions based on public sentiments. To detect fake news"
Page 15," The pre-processing pipeline will be dependent on type of text data we are working with . Social media from media like WSJ, Reuters are usually well-structured and can be extracted relatively easily ."
Page 16," Before training the sentiment analysis models, we need to ensure that the training is of sufficiently high quality . Garbage in garbage out phenomenon is very real . There are two ways of improving the quality of the training corpora: Having domain experts"
Page 17, Step 4: Sentiment Classification  and Scoring . Different levels of sentiment classification (e.g document-level and sentence-level)
Page 18, Key performance indicators (KPIs) refer to a set of quantifiable measurements used to gauge a business value of the system . KPIs are related to the concept of Return on Investment (ROI)
Page 19, Lexicon-based semi-supervised approach to the world's most complex computer systems is being used in the U.S. 1.1919.19.
Page 20, Lexicon semi-supervised approach uses observations from words/ their patterns to construct rules for sentiment scores . The sentiment scores from individual ‘patterns’ are aggregated and aggregated .
Page 21," Lexicon-based approach uses a sentiment lexicon (patterns - words, iopinions, idioms) and composite expression, composite expression ."

Page 23," Creating the Opinion Lexicon is a combination of manual, dictionary and corpus-based approaches . Manual: by inspection, by inspection; dictionary: own source, WordNet, SenitWordNet for words/phrases; corpus:"

Page 28, The quantity or change of quantity of potential positive or negative items (PositivePolarity Item) is the quantity or . change of the potential  positive or  negative items . These items include “battery life”
Page 29," When multiple sentiment words occur together, “terribly(-) good(+)’s “pretty (+) ugly (-)” is ‘pretty’ and ‘ugly’, ‘terribly"

Page 31, “Fast forward” “I’m feeling lucky” is a sentiment word . Sentiment words in non-opinion contexts: “Best Denki” and “Hope you get well soon
Page 32, Many sentiment words have multiple meanings or senses and they do  not always express sentiment in all contexts . Words with different senses can have different sentiment .
Page 33, Unsupervised training method is shown to perform well in a large number of applications . Supervised training is dependent on training data which needs to be manually labelled for each domain . Models trained in one domain often perform poorly in

Page 35, The Supervised Classifier System is a self-learned computer-controlled system . It is designed to be able to monitor and train people to identify and identify a person . It was designed to teach people how to use the system .

Page 37, Training data for sentiment analysis was used to train data on sentiment analysis . The training data was used in the form of training data to train people to understand sentiment .
Page 38," The training and test data sets should be used from the same domain as far as possible . In generating training data set, go for “high-precision” and “low recall”"
Page 39," The training data set is usually not static but requires fine-tuning even after production . This helps to account for changing fads in expressions, languages slangs etc as well ."
Page 40," First, a revision over synsets (revision primer from Text Mining) Then expand and modify the dictionary corpus . Using existing dictionary corpus, egs are: sentWordNet, SentWordNet and public sources eg. Liu"
Page 41," WordNet is a large lexical database of English . Nouns, verbs, jectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms . SentiWordnet adds on to WordNet by assigning sentiment polarity ."
Page 42, The bootstrapping of wordnet’s synsets can be understood in 2 steps . Use a seed set of positive                 and negative words with                 their sentiment . These words then takes on the original seedset�
Page 43, Use the meta-data in social media to assign positive  or negative ratings to the comment posts . Use high or low ratings as  positive labels; and  high ratings as negative labels .
Page 44, User-generated ratings are based on user-generated reviews . Mind the biased reviews. Mind the bias of the reviews. Remember your reviews .
Page 45, Features for sentiment analysis: 2.45.45 . Features for the sentiment analysis are based on sentiment analysis . The sentiment analysis is a form of analysis of sentiment in the form of sentiment analysis.
Page 46, Some common features used in sentiment analysis are: POS tags (adjectives or nouns) Part of speech tags (POS tags) and phrases (n-grams) Syntactic dependency (more about this on Day 3) The
Page 47, Feature Selection (or extraction) is used to select relevant features and reduce the number of  features used in the matrix . Various ways (trial-and-error) include removing features that appear rarely in the documents .
Page 48, Two key steps before building a sentiment analysis are: Training data (corpus) selection/ generation and Features selection . These pre-steps are key to the success of a sentiment analysis .
