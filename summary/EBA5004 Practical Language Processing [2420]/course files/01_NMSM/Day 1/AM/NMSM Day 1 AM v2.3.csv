4,"The document discusses the basics of sentiment analysis in new media, including its definition and purpose. It explains that sentiment analysis is the process of identifying and extracting subjective information from text data, such as opinions, attitudes, and emotions. The purpose of sentiment analysis is to gain insights into public opinion and sentiment towards a particular topic or brand. It also mentions the importance of understanding the context and limitations of sentiment analysis, as well as the different approaches and tools used in the process. Overall, the introduction provides a brief overview of sentiment analysis and its relevance in today's digital world."
5,"Traditional media refers to traditional forms of media such as print, film, radio, and television, while new media refers to digital forms of media including social media, internet advertisements, podcasts, vlogs, and blogs. Traditional media marketing is one-way communication aimed at a mass audience, while digital media marketing is more interactive and allows for bidirectional communication."
6,"The social web is currently fragmented, with consumers having different identities on each social network. However, there is a shift towards a shared social experience, where consumers will rely on their peers for decisions and communities will have more power. This will lead to a new generation of products defined by empowered communities, rather than just brands and CRM systems."
7,"Sentiment analysis, also known as Sentiment Mining or Opinion Mining, is a field of study that analyzes people's opinions, sentiments, appraisals, attitudes, and emotions expressed in written text. It focuses on entities such as products, services, organizations, individuals, events, issues, or topics. This field is a large problem space and has been an active research area in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Examples of entities that can be annotated for sentiment analysis include products, services, organizations, individuals, events, issues, and topics."
8,"The document discusses the definition of an opinion in the context of sentiment analysis. It states that an opinion can refer to sentiment, emotion, judgement, or evaluation. This is important to understand in order to accurately analyze and interpret people's opinions."
9,"An opinion is defined as a quintuple, consisting of the name of an entity, an aspect of that entity, the sentiment expressed on that aspect, the opinion holder, and the time of expression. The sentiment can be positive, negative, or neutral, with varying levels of strength or intensity."
10,"Sentiment analysis involves analyzing text to determine the subjective opinions and attitudes of individuals. It typically includes subjectivity classification, polarity classification, opinion summarization, sarcasm detection, entity, opinion holder, and time extraction, coreference resolution and word sense disambiguation, opinion search and retrieval, and opinion spam detection. These techniques are used to understand and extract opinions from social media and other sources."
11,"The case study of smartphone reviews is used to illustrate the tasks involved in Sentiment Analysis. As of 2021, there are approximately 6.23 billion smartphone users, with an expected increase to 7.7 billion by 2027. GSMArena is an online platform that offers comprehensive information on mobile phones and their features."
12,"In sentiment analysis of smartphone reviews, it is important to differentiate between subjective and objective sentences. Objective sentences do not require any further analysis for polarity, while subjective sentences need methods to determine their polarity."
13,"The document discusses the process of polarity classification, which is used to determine the sentiment associated with a sentence in a phone review. This method relies on certain assumptions, such as a sentence expressing a single opinion and being completed with punctuations like ""."" and ""?"". It also assumes that a sentence captures the opinion within a clear context. This method is commonly used to predict product reviews and is employed by companies like Microsoft."
14,"The document discusses the challenges of extracting entities, opinion holders, and time from a collection of smartphone reviews. These reviews may mention multiple entities, have different opinion holders, and be expressed at different times. Additionally, each entity may have multiple aspects that users can comment on, such as screen size or battery ratings. This type of analysis is known as Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis."
15,"Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a process that involves extracting aspects related to an entity and analyzing sentiments associated with them over time. It aims to provide a comprehensive opinion summary at the aspect level, which can be useful for downstream applications such as opinion summarization. Key tasks of ABSA include extracting and categorizing entities and aspects, sentiment classification, and identifying opinion holders. This process is important for understanding and analyzing opinions and sentiments in a more detailed and fine-grained manner."
16,Opinion summarization is a method used to summarize the opinions from a large number of phone reviews. It differs from traditional text summarization in that it focuses on aggregating sentiments about entities and their aspects rather than important sentences. It is often used for sentiment visualization and can provide a quantitative summary of sentiments in a systematic manner.
17,"Sarcasm is a complex type of speech in which the speaker says something positive but means something negative, or vice versa. It is challenging to detect sarcasm in sentiment analysis because it often requires common sense knowledge and discourse analysis. While sarcasm is not commonly found in formal phone reviews, it is more prevalent in online discussions and user reviews."
18,"Coreference resolution is an important task in determining opinion targets, such as the Galaxy Fold 3 phone, as it helps identify all expressions that refer to the same entity in a text. Word-sense disambiguation is the process of identifying the meaning of a word when it appears with other context words, which can be challenging in analyzing social media opinions. Examples of coreference resolution and word-sense disambiguation are provided from external sources."
19,"The document discusses the task of opinion search and retrieval, which involves searching and ranking relevant documents or sentences that express opinions on a particular entity or topic. This process requires finding relevant documents and determining the sentiment expressed towards the entity. Traditional web search engines do not consider sentiment scores in their ranking, which can lead to biased results. The ideal outcome is to produce a summary of opinions, which is now possible with LLM+Search technology."
20,"Opinions in reviews and social media are often used to make decisions, making it a target for opinion spammers who post fake reviews to promote or discredit products and services. Two common approaches to detecting opinion spam are burst detection, which looks for dense areas in the arrival pattern of reviews, and review spammer detection, which uses reviewer modeling to infer the real identities of reviewers. This is important because fake reviews can influence consumer decisions and impact businesses."
21,"The document discusses three general approaches to sentiment analysis: rule-based, ML-based, and hybrid. Rule-based systems use human-crafted rules to identify subjectivity, polarity, or the subject of an opinion. NLP techniques such as stemming, tokenization, part-of-speech, and parsing are used in this approach. ML-based systems rely on machine learning techniques to learn from data and involve steps such as pre-processing, feature generation, extraction, training, and prediction. Hybrid systems combine the desirable elements of rule-based and ML-based techniques and often produce more accurate results."
22,"Lexicon-based systems use a dictionary to analyze text and assign scores to words based on their sentiment. However, they can be limited because they do not consider word combinations and may require frequent updates. Some lexicon dictionaries can handle emoticons, negations, and intensity markers to improve accuracy."
23,"The National University of Singapore outlines a machine learning-based approach to data processing. The first step involves obtaining raw input data from sources such as text, web, pdf, or images using OCR. The data then undergoes pre-processing, including HTML cleaning, tokenization, stemming or lemmatization, and handling negation, spelling correction, and slang removal. Next, feature extraction is performed using techniques such as bag of words, bag of N-grams, TF-IDF, or word embedding's. Model training can be done through supervised, unsupervised, or self-supervised methods, using pre-built models or improvising them for specific domains or use-cases. Finally, prediction scoring methods such as accuracy, recall, and F1"
24,"The hybrid approach to natural language processing combines the strengths of rule-based and machine learning methods. It allows for the use of domain-specific lexicons and rules, which can improve performance in situations where there is limited training data available. This approach also offers more flexibility for domain experts to intervene and handle complex tasks using rule-based methods and updated lexicon dictionaries. It promotes the idea of collaborative intelligence between computers and humans."
25,"The document discusses three levels of sentiment analysis: document-level, sentence-level, and aspect-level. Document-level analysis looks at the overall sentiment of a text, while sentence-level analysis focuses on the sentiment of individual sentences. Aspect-level analysis breaks down the sentiment by specific aspects or topics within a text. Each level has its own challenges and techniques, and they can be combined to get a more comprehensive understanding of sentiment in a text."
26,"Sentiment analysis can be done at three different levels: message, sentence, and entity/aspect. At the message level, the goal is to classify the overall polarity of a message, such as a phone review, as positive, negative, or neutral. At the sentence level, the aim is to determine the polarity of each individual sentence in the message. Finally, at the entity and aspect level, a finer-grained analysis is performed by identifying the sentiment and target of opinion in a sentence. For example, in the sentence ""The iPhone is very good, but they still need to work on battery life and security issues,"" the aspects of iPhone, battery life, and security are evaluated as positive, negative, and negative respectively."
