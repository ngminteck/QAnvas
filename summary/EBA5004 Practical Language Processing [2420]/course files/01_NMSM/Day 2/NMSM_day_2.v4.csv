2,"The second page of the document outlines the agenda for the day, which includes a comparison between statistical modelling and deep neural networks, an introduction to deep learning basics for natural language processing (NLP), a workshop on basic neural networks on Colab, and a discussion on Word2Vec and its use in deep learning. The workshop will cover topics such as CBOW and SkipGram, activation and loss functions, and optimizers and learning rates, with a hands-on exercise on building Word2Vec from scratch."
3,"The document discusses how natural language processing (NLP) works, which involves using machine learning and computer processing to analyze and understand human language. It also includes a section on customer reviews of a high tea experience at Raffles, where the service and location received high ratings but some reviewers noted a decline in glamour over time. The document also mentions a feature matrix for NLP, which involves using supervised and unsupervised learning methods."
4,"The document compares classic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to deep learning approaches. It notes that frequency TF-IDF and PPMI vectors are long and sparse, making them efficient for simple tasks with large datasets. They are also interpretable, as they are designed by human intelligence. However, they struggle to capture contextual dependencies. Examples of the vectors are given, along with a redacted phone number."
5,"The document discusses the use of statistical modelling in various natural language processing tasks, such as document and sentence classification, sequence labeling, language modeling, and machine translation. It mentions specific models that can be used for each task, such as SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes, MaxEnt, HMM, CRF, and N-gram. It also suggests combining phrase or tree-based models with beam search for machine translation. The author acknowledges that all models are imperfect, but some can still be useful for these tasks."
6,"NLP (Natural Language Processing) works by using algorithms and machine learning to analyze and understand human language. It can automatically generate a feature matrix and perform tasks independently. The NUS team has developed a system that can generate this matrix and learn from data, making it a useful tool for analyzing large amounts of text data."
7,"NLP (Natural Language Processing) works by using algorithms and machine learning to analyze and understand human language. This can involve tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and language translation. NLP techniques can be supervised or unsupervised, and can use different types of machine learning such as DNN (Deep Neural Networks) or traditional ML (Machine Learning). NLP is used in various applications, such as sentiment analysis of customer reviews, as shown in the example of the Raffles hotel."
8,"Deep learning is a powerful approach in natural language processing (NLP) that creates short, dense, and non-interpretable feature vectors that can capture contextual dependency and are beneficial for various NLP tasks such as classification, sequence labeling, translation, and question-answering. This is in contrast to classic NLP, which relies on human intelligence to create feature vectors and may not be as effective in capturing contextual information."
9,"The agenda for day 2 of the NMSM workshop includes a focus on deep learning basics for natural language processing (NLP), including multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a quiz on deep learning training routines. Participants will also engage in a workshop on building deep learning models from scratch. The session will also cover Word2Vec and its use in deep learning, including CBOW and SkipGram models, as well as important concepts such as activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers/learning rates. Participants will have the opportunity to apply these concepts in a workshop on building a Word2Vec model from scratch."
10,"The document discusses the basics of deep learning, focusing on the concept of the perceptron. A perceptron is a system that relies on probabilistic principles and statistical measurements from a large population of elements. The human brain is estimated to have around 100 billion perceptrons. Modern deep learning models, such as BERT and GPT, have significantly more parameters, with BERT having 110 million to 17 billion parameters and GPT having 1.5 billion to 175 billion parameters. The image from Akshay Chandra Lagandula's blog shows the potential for even larger models, with the upcoming GPT4 estimated to have even more parameters."
11,"The perceptron is a learning algorithm that uses a set of inputs to map them to a real-value output between 0 and 1. This is achieved by calculating the dot product of the weight vector and the inputs, and passing it through an activation function. The goal of the perceptron is to learn the optimal weight vector that can accurately classify the inputs."
12,"The Perceptron is a type of algorithm used for word level classification, where words are labeled as either positive (1) or negative (0). The algorithm uses a function (f) to determine the label based on the input words (x1-x5). In this example, the words ""like,"" ""hate,"" ""good,"" ""enjoy,"" and ""bad"" are being classified, and their corresponding labels are determined by the function (f)."
13,"(1,1)

The document discusses the use of a perceptron for word level classification, where positive words are assigned a value of 1 and negative words are assigned a value of 0. The vocabulary size is set to 5, and the words are represented by x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5. The weights for each word are denoted as w1, w2, w3, w4, and w5. The document also shows an example of how the weights are used to classify words, with a focus on the word [REDACTED_PHONE]."
14,"The Perceptron algorithm is used for word level classification, with positive words being assigned a value of 1 and negative words a value of 0. The vocabulary size, n, is set to 5 and the batch size is 1. Unknown words are handled by using a weight, w1, and a function, f(6), to determine their classification. The weight is used to adjust the output of the function, with the values (1,5), (5,1), and (1,1) being used for different scenarios."
15,"The perceptron is a type of algorithm used for word-level classification, where words are assigned a value of either positive (1) or negative (0). The vocabulary size is denoted as n=26, and each letter in the alphabet is represented by a corresponding x value. For example, the word ""like"" would have a value of 0 for all x values except for x1, which would be 1. This representation is used to train the perceptron, where weights (w1-w26) are assigned to each x value and a bias term (s) is added. The output (f(s)) is then compared to the desired classification (1 or 0) and the weights are adjusted accordingly."
16,"The document discusses the use of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for word level classification. This involves assigning a numerical value to each word in a vocabulary, with a higher value indicating a positive sentiment and a lower value indicating a negative sentiment. The MLP consists of multiple layers and parameters, with each layer representing a different aspect of the data. The weights for each word are adjusted during training to improve the accuracy of the classification. The final output is a binary classification of either 1 or 0, indicating positive or negative sentiment."
17,"The document discusses forward propagation in neural networks, specifically for word level classification. This involves assigning weights to each letter in the alphabet and using multiple layers to make predictions for words. The vocabulary size is typically 26, and this method involves more parameters and layers compared to other types of classification. The final output is a prediction of the word's sentiment, such as positive or negative."
18,"The deep learning training routine involves repeating a series of steps until a desired level of performance is achieved. This includes initializing weights using a random or one-hot encoding method, performing forward propagation, computing and logging the loss, and then using back propagation to adjust the weights. An optimizer is also used to further improve the performance of the model."
19,"This section discusses the deep learning training routine, which involves a ""brute force"" searching action with a strategy to reach the desired outcome. The first step is to compute and keep track of the cost or loss, which is defined as the difference between the predicted output and the correct output. Next, the backpropagation process involves computing the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to the weights in each layer, using the chain rule. The optimizer then uses a combination of ""brute force"" searching and a strategy, such as gradient descent and the delta rule, to adjust the weights in order to minimize the loss. This is done by updating the weights based on the derivative rate and a small learning rate, to avoid making large adjustments."
20,".

The document discusses an example of a loss function for a machine learning model with 5 training examples. The loss function is used to measure the difference between the predicted output and the true output. The example shows how the loss function is calculated and how it can be optimized using a gradient descent algorithm. The document also provides a step-by-step calculation of the optimization process."
21,"The document discusses the concept of gradient descent, which is a method for minimizing a ""fake"" loss function in order to optimize a model. The Delta rule is then applied, which involves adjusting the weights of the model based on the gradient of the loss function. A specific example is given, with a learning rate of 0.3 and an initial weight of 3, resulting in a final weight of 2.16 after two iterations."
22,"The chain rule is a mathematical concept that allows for the calculation of the gradient of a function composed of multiple variables. In the context of machine learning, it is used to update the weights of a neural network during training. The weights are updated based on the difference between the predicted output and the correct output, multiplied by the chain of derivatives of the function. This process is repeated for each weight in the network until the loss function is minimized. The chain rule is an essential tool for optimizing neural networks and improving their performance."
23,"The deep learning training routine involves initializing weights for all layers, performing forward propagation to reach the final layer and get the predicted output, computing and keeping track of the cost or loss, back propagation to calculate the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to the weights for all layers, and using an optimizer to update the weights based on the derivative rate and learning rate. This process is repeated until the desired level of performance is achieved, similar to a dress rehearsal."
24,"The workshop on day 2 of the NMSM conference covered the basics of neural networks on Colab. The main focus was on Word2Vec and its specific techniques, such as CBOW and SkipGram. The workshop also discussed important concepts like activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers, as well as the role of learning rate in training neural networks. The attendees also participated in a workshop on creating Word2Vec from scratch."
25,"The document discusses the specifics of Word2Vec and deep learning, presented by Dr. Wang Aobo. Word2Vec is a popular algorithm used for natural language processing, which represents words as vectors in high-dimensional space. Deep learning involves using neural networks to process and analyze large amounts of data. Dr. Wang Aobo's presentation covers the applications and limitations of Word2Vec and deep learning, as well as their integration and potential future developments."
26,"The document discusses the challenges of generating and selecting features for natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis. It suggests using WordToVec, a method that automatically generates ""universal"" features based on word level vector representation. This approach can save time and effort in feature generation and selection."
27,"The document discusses different methods for creating word vectors, which are numerical representations of words that capture their meaning and relationships with other words. These methods include counting data and using word co-occurrence with singular value decomposition (SVD), learning from data using continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) and skip-gram models, and combining counting and learning with the GLOVE model. These techniques are important for natural language processing tasks such as language translation and sentiment analysis."
28,"The document discusses word-level representation in natural language processing and how it involves counting context words within a specified window size. This is demonstrated through three example sentences and a window size of 1, showing how the words ""like"" and ""enjoy"" are counted as context words for the words ""deep learning"" and ""NLP"" respectively. This method can be used to create numerical representations of words in a text."
29,"This section discusses the use of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in data analysis. SVD is a mathematical technique used to decompose a matrix into its constituent parts, making it easier to analyze. The example given uses a matrix with data on likes, enjoys, and proficiency in deep learning and natural language processing (NLP). The matrix is sorted by its singular values, which represent the importance of each feature in the data. The result is a more organized and simplified representation of the data."
30,"vec([REDACTED_PHONE])

The content on page 30 of 'NMSM_day_2.v4.pdf' discusses the concept of vectorizing data, which involves converting data into a numerical format for analysis. It explains that in this process, each unique item in the data is assigned a vector, and similar items are given similar vectors. The example given is a dataset with words and their corresponding sentiment scores, where each word is converted into a vector and words with similar sentiment scores are given similar vectors. The page also includes a table showing the sorted singular values of the dataset."
31,"The document discusses different methods for generating word embeddings, which are numerical representations of words that capture their semantic relationships. These methods include counting word occurrences in data and applying singular value decomposition (SVD), using neural network models such as Word2Vec, and combining counting and learning approaches with models like GLOVE (Global Vectors for Word Representation). These methods allow for the creation of word embeddings that can be used for various natural language processing tasks."
32,"GLOVE (Global Vectors for Word Representation) is a word-level representation model that counts context-words within a specified window size. For example, in the sentences ""I like deep learning,"" ""I like NLP,"" and ""I enjoy flying,"" with a window size of 1, the word ""like"" has 2 context-words (I and NLP) and the word ""I"" has 2 context-words (like and enjoy). This method helps to capture the relationships between words and their contexts, allowing for more accurate word representations."
33,"The GLOVE algorithm, or Global Vectors for Word Representation, is used to create word-level representations by counting context-words within a specified window size. For example, in the sentences ""I like deep learning"" and ""I like NLP,"" the window size of 1 would result in a count of 2 for the context-word ""like"" in relation to the word ""I."" This count is then used to calculate the probability of the context-word given the word, and the logarithm of this probability is used to create the word representation."
34,"The document discusses the GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) model, which is used for creating word embeddings in natural language processing (NLP). It uses the concept of co-occurrence to map words to vectors and calculate their probabilities, with a focus on optimizing for semantic relationships between words. The formula for calculating the probability of two words occurring together is log (Cij) = log (vi ‚óè vj), where vi and vj are the vectors representing the two words. This approach is used to create more accurate and meaningful word embeddings for tasks such as sentiment analysis and language translation."
35,"The document discusses the GloVe algorithm, which is used for creating word embeddings. This algorithm uses a least square loss function to map the vector representations of words to their co-occurrence probabilities. The window size is set to 1, meaning that only adjacent words are considered. The document also provides an example of how the algorithm works, using the words ""I like"" and their corresponding vector representations. The goal is to minimize the loss function by adjusting the vectors and biases until the expected value matches the actual value. This approach allows for efficient and accurate word representations, making it useful for tasks such as natural language processing and deep learning."
36,"The document discusses the GloVe algorithm, which is used for creating word embeddings. It involves a weighted least square loss function that takes into account the co-occurrence probabilities of words. The weight function is defined in a way that assigns higher weights to larger co-occurrence probabilities and has an upper bound. The algorithm also uses a window size of 1 and incorporates constraints to ensure that the weight function is well-behaved."
37,"The content discusses the GLOVE algorithm, which is used for word representation in natural language processing (NLP). The algorithm uses a window size of 1 and a weight function to determine the similarity between words based on their co-occurrence in a corpus. The weight function is determined by the frequency of co-occurrence, with a threshold of 100 and a power of 0.75. The algorithm also has constraints, such as a weight of 0 for no co-occurrence and an upper bound for large co-occurrence values. Overall, GLOVE is a powerful tool for representing words in NLP tasks."
38,"The document discusses the GLOVE (Global Vectors for Word Representation) model, which is used for creating word embeddings in natural language processing (NLP). The model is based on the co-occurrence matrix, which represents the frequency of words appearing together in a given window size. The formula for calculating the co-occurrence probability is log (P (I,like)) = log(CI,like / CI ) = log (CI,like ) ‚Äì log(CI ), where CI,like refers to the co-occurrence of ""I"" and ""like"". The model expects to map the vectors representing ""I"" and ""like"" to the log of their co-occurrence, log (Cij )."
39,"The document discusses the use of word vectors in natural language processing, specifically the Count-based model and the GLOVE model. These models use data such as word co-occurrence and singular value decomposition (SVD) to learn from large amounts of text data. They also utilize neural network methods, such as CBOW and SKIPGRAM, to create predictive models based on word counts. The GLOVE model, in particular, uses a combination of count data and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to improve word representation. These methods are important for understanding and analyzing text data in various applications."
40,"One-hot encoding is a method of representing data in a sparse manner, where each unique value in a dataset is assigned a binary value. This is commonly used in natural language processing, where words are represented as binary vectors in a vocabulary. This allows for efficient storage and processing of large datasets."
41,"The lookup function is a method used for encoding words in natural language processing. It involves creating a one-hot encoding for each word in a vocabulary, and then using word embeddings to convert these one-hot vectors into a lower-dimensional representation. This representation is then used as input for a prediction task, allowing the model to learn the relationships between words and make accurate predictions."
42,"The concept of Word2Vec (CBOW) is discussed, which involves understanding the relationship between words and their meanings. This is achieved through a classification task and the use of a window size of 2. Linguistic questions often revolve around the difference between the letters ""a"" and ""m"" and how they are used in language. This understanding can be applied to other linguistic phenomena."
43,"The Word2Vec (CBOW) task involves iterating through every word within a given window and learning a parameter W that allows the model to predict the word given only the context words as inputs. The model is represented by W1 (V,N) and N (4,N), and the training data is represented by X_train and Y_train. The goal is to predict the word ""talk"" in the sentence ""give a ______ at the [REDACTED_PHONE]."""
44,The Word2Vec (CBOW) model uses a window size to predict a target word based on its surrounding context. It involves reshaping the values and rows of a matrix to improve efficiency.
45,"The document discusses the concept of naive sentence embedding, which involves representing words in a sentence as vectors and then combining them using pooling methods such as AVG(), MAX(), MIN(), or Concat() to create a sentence vector. The example given is for the sentence ""give a at the,"" where each word is represented by a vector and then combined using one of the pooling methods. This method is commonly used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for natural language processing tasks."
46,The Word2Vec (CBOW) model uses a window size to predict a target word from surrounding context words. It involves reshaping the values and rows of the input matrix to improve efficiency.
47,"The activation function in a neural network is responsible for creating a smoother decision function and ensuring that the activations are bound in a range of 0 to 1. This allows for the use of backpropagation, which is a key aspect of training neural networks. It is important for the activation function to be non-linear in order to properly capture complex relationships between inputs and outputs. There are various types of activation functions that can be used, each with their own advantages and disadvantages."
48,"The activation function is a mathematical function used in neural networks to determine the output of a node. One commonly used function is the sigmoid function, which produces a smooth output between 0 and 1. This can be interpreted as a probability of ""Yes"" and is often used in classification tasks. The image from Wikipedia shows the shape of the sigmoid function."
49,"The Tanh function is an activation function that produces a smooth output between -1 and 1, with a centroid of 0. It is often interpreted as a set of weights in neural networks."
50,"Page 50 of the NMSM_day_2.v4.pdf document discusses the activation function, specifically the sigmoid function, and its impact on the gradient during training. The sigmoid function is commonly used in neural networks to introduce non-linearity. However, it can lead to the problem of exploding or vanishing gradient, where the gradient becomes too large or too small, respectively, making it difficult for the network to learn. This can be mitigated by using alternative activation functions such as ReLU or by using techniques like gradient clipping."
51,"The activation function ReLU is a simple and fast way to smooth out decision functions in neural networks. It bounds activations in a range and has a ""0"" centroid, making it a useful tool for training. However, intuitions can be useless when using neural networks, and the vanishing gradient problem may still occur."
52,"The document discusses the ReLU activation function, which is commonly used in neural networks. ReLU stands for Rectified Linear Unit and is a type of non-linear activation function. It is a simple function that returns the maximum of 0 and the input value. ReLU is preferred over other activation functions because it is computationally efficient, avoids the vanishing gradient problem, and allows for faster training of deep neural networks. There are various variations of ReLU, such as Leaky ReLU, PReLU, and ELU, that aim to improve its performance."
53,"The Word2Vec (CBOW) model uses a neural network with two layers, W1 and W2, to predict a target word given a context of words. The input layer (V,N) takes in a one-hot encoded vector of size V, representing the context words, and outputs a hidden layer of size N. The hidden layer is then passed through a non-linear activation function (Relu) and multiplied by the weight matrix W2 to get a (4,N) matrix. This is then reduced to a (1,N) vector by taking the average. The output layer (1,V) uses a softmax function to calculate the probability of each word in the vocabulary being the target word. The model is trained by adjusting the weights"
54,"The last layer activation function, SoftMax, is used to convert a vector of xi inputs into a vector of probabilities. It is important to note that SoftMax should never be applied to a single input, as it will always output a probability of 1."
55,"The sigmoid function is a smooth mathematical function that produces outputs between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as probabilities. This function is often used as the last layer activation function in neural networks, with a single input and output. It should never be used with a vector of inputs."
56,"The Word2Vec (CBOW) Loss Function, developed by NUS, is used to train a neural network to predict a target word based on its surrounding context words. It involves using a matrix of word embeddings, W1 and W2, to represent the input and output words, and a softmax function to calculate the loss. The loss is then minimized using the average and ReLU functions."
57,"The document discusses the cross entropy loss function for categorical data, which is commonly used in machine learning algorithms. The function calculates the difference between the predicted and actual values, and penalizes larger differences more heavily. It is represented by the symbol CE and is used to evaluate the performance of a model. The document also includes an example of how the loss function is calculated using embeddings and the softmax function. The overall loss is determined by summing the individual losses for each category."
58,"The document discusses the cross entropy loss function for categorical data, which is used to measure the difference between predicted and actual values. This function is commonly used in natural language processing tasks. The formula for cross entropy loss involves taking the negative logarithm of the predicted probability for each class and summing them together. The document also mentions using embeddings and the softmax function to improve the accuracy of the model."
59,"The document discusses the Binary Cross Entropy Loss Function, which is used in the CBOW (Continuous Bag-of-Words) model for natural language processing. This function calculates the loss between predicted and actual labels, with a goal of minimizing the loss. The formula for this function involves taking the logarithm of the predicted probability and multiplying it by -1, then summing the results. The document provides an example of using this function to classify spam emails, with a higher loss for spam emails and a lower loss for non-spam emails. The goal is to find the best parameters for the model that will minimize the overall loss."
60,"The document discusses the Word2Vec (CBOW) algorithm, which uses backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to train a model that can predict words based on their context. The model consists of two weight matrices, W1 and W2, which are updated using the cross-entropy loss function and the average of the hidden layer values. The update equations for W1 and W2 involve the learning rate (lr) and the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights."
61,"The document discusses two popular optimization algorithms for training neural networks: SGD and Adam. SGD is faster but may not always converge, while Adam is slower but generally leads to better generalization. These two algorithms are often used together with momentum to achieve better results."
62,"Backpropagation is a common method used in machine learning to adjust the weights of a model based on the error between the predicted and actual outputs. The learning rate, which determines the size of weight adjustments, is an important factor in backpropagation. For simpler models like MLP, RNN, and CNN, a learning rate of 10^-2 to 10^-3 is typically used, while more complex models like LSTM and CNN may require a learning rate of 10^-3. For very complex models like BERT, a smaller learning rate of 10^-5 is recommended based on experience."
63,"Backpropagation is a commonly used algorithm for training neural networks. It involves adjusting the weights of the network based on the error between the predicted output and the actual output. One important aspect of backpropagation is the learning rate, which determines the size of the weight updates. A fixed learning rate can lead to the fastest decrease in loss, but it is important to monitor and potentially increase the learning rate as the number of iterations increases. It is also recommended to save and plot the loss as a function of the learning rate and iteration to determine the optimal learning rate for the network."
64,"The concept of backpropagation is introduced as a method for training neural networks. It involves estimating an initial learning rate and then implementing a dynamic learning rate, which adjusts the learning rate throughout the training process. This approach allows for more efficient and effective learning, as the learning rate can be adapted to the specific needs of the network. The specifics of programming a dynamic learning rate are also discussed."
65,"The content on page 65 of the document 'NMSM_day_2.v4.pdf' discusses the Word2Vec (CBOW) method and its application in natural language processing. CBOW is a neural network model that predicts a word based on its context. It involves using a window size and a vocabulary size to determine the input and output dimensions. The model uses a Softmax function and Cross-Entropy Loss to calculate the probability of a word given its context. The process also involves reshaping the rows, values, and columns to improve the accuracy of the predictions."
66,The CBOW model is a type of neural network that is used for language processing and is based on the distributional hypothesis. It predicts a word based on its context by using a hidden layer to represent the context words and an output layer to predict the target word. The model is trained using a corpus of text data and uses a softmax function to calculate the probability of each word in the vocabulary being the target word. The CBOW model has been shown to perform well in various language processing tasks and can be further improved by incorporating additional features and techniques.
67,The Word2Vec Skipgram task involves predicting context words for each word within a given window. This is done by iterating through each word and using a window to determine the context words. This method is described in the Stanford cs224n course by Manning (2018).
68,"The Word2Vec skipgram model is a popular method for learning word embeddings, which represent words as vectors in a high-dimensional space. This model takes into account the context of a word by predicting the surrounding words in a sentence. It is based on the idea that language users do not choose words randomly and that language is essentially non-random. The model takes in a word and outputs a list of words that are likely to appear in its context."
69,"The content on page 69 discusses the Word2Vec algorithm, specifically the Skipgram model. This model is used to predict the context of a word by looking at the words that surround it in a sentence. The algorithm uses a sliding window approach to create training data, where the window size is determined by the user. The algorithm also uses negative sampling, which helps to improve efficiency and accuracy by randomly selecting non-context words to train on. This approach allows for better representation of the relationships between words and their contexts."
70,"The document discusses the Word2Vec (Skipgram) algorithm, which is used to represent words in a vector space. This algorithm is based on the idea that words are not chosen randomly in language, and that language is essentially non-random. The algorithm uses Relu and Dot functions to map words to vectors, and calculates a loss value to measure the accuracy of the mapping. The example sentence used is ""language users never choose words randomly""."
71,"The Skipgram model is a type of Word2Vec model used for natural language processing. It is based on the idea of predicting context words given a target word. This model is trained on a large corpus of text data and learns to represent words as vectors in a high-dimensional space. These vectors capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words, making them useful for tasks such as word similarity and analogy detection. The Skipgram model has been shown to outperform other models in capturing complex linguistic patterns and has been widely used in various applications such as text classification and information retrieval."
72,"The choice of context window size can greatly impact the resulting word embeddings. A smaller window size tends to capture more syntactic information, while a larger window size captures more semantic information. For example, a small window size may result in embeddings that reflect the grammatical structure of a sentence, while a larger window size may result in embeddings that reflect the overall meaning or topic of a text. Ultimately, the appropriate context window size depends on the specific task or application at hand."
73,"The key points on page 73 of the document 'NMSM_day_2.v4.pdf' discuss the properties of word embeddings. These include using a large corpus of text for training, annotations, initializing weights for each word, implementing a deep learning model, and using an appropriate cost function. Additionally, having access to a GPU is important for efficient processing."
74,"Pre-trained embeddings are useful when there is a lack of training or annotated data. They can be used as inputs for classification tasks such as tagging, parsing, and ranking based on similarity. However, they are less useful for tasks such as machine translation or sequence generation. Generic language modeling tasks have their own sentence embeddings and do not require pre-trained embeddings."
75,"Page 75 of the document 'NMSM_day_2.v4.pdf' discusses the concept of embedding bias, which refers to the implicit biases that are embedded in the algorithms used in machine learning. These biases can be unintentionally incorporated into the data and algorithms used for decision-making, resulting in biased outcomes. To address this issue, it is important to identify and mitigate biases in the data and algorithms, as well as involve diverse perspectives in the development and use of machine learning systems."
76,"The document discusses the steps for implementing Word2Vec, a popular method for creating word embeddings. These steps include defining the task to be predicted, creating input and output pairs for each sentence, using embeddings and models to make predictions, measuring the cost of the predicted and expected output, and updating the embedding weights through backpropagation. It is noted that neither GloVe nor Word2Vec has been proven to be definitively better, and it is recommended to evaluate both for a given dataset."
77,"The document discusses training Word2Vec models from scratch using the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram methods. It explains the steps involved in the training process, including data preparation, model architecture, and optimization techniques. The document also compares the performance of CBOW and Skip-gram models and provides recommendations for choosing the appropriate method based on the dataset and task at hand. Overall, the document aims to provide a comprehensive guide for training Word2Vec models from scratch."
78,"The article discusses various studies and approaches related to word similarity and language understanding. These include using co-occurrence based measures, automatic text summarization, deep contextualized word representations, generative pre-training, attention-based models, universal language model fine-tuning, and global vectors for word representation. The references cited include various research papers from conferences and journals."
