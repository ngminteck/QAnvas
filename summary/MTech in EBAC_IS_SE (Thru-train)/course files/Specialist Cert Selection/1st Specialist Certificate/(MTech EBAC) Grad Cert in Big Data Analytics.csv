Page Number,Summary
1,"The Graduate Certificate in Big Data Analytics focuses on equipping students with the skills to build models for handling large amounts of data, cleansing and transforming the data, and using it for predictions and analysis related to individual habits, behaviors, and preferences. The program includes modules on understanding big data frameworks and ecosystems, developing data pipelines, and building end-to-end solutions for business requirements. Other modules cover the role and applications of recommendation systems, implementing data processing solutions, and developing analytics solutions for smart applications and products. The program also covers implementing intelligent solutions using location, sensor, and customer transactional data."
2,"The Big Data Engineering for Analytics course is a 5-day training program that teaches participants how to effectively work with big data projects. The course covers topics such as identifying valuable data sources, implementing data ingestion, designing storage, and building resilient distributed datasets. Participants will also learn how to build scalable data pipeline solutions using a combination of vendor/technology agnostic components. The course focuses on working with the Spark platform and includes instruction on query and streaming libraries. The target audience for this course includes application architects, data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. Topics covered in the course include a reference architecture for big data engineering, big data modeling and design, data ingestion, and managing big data projects."
3,"The Recommender Systems course is a 3-day program that teaches data analysts, marketers, and business leaders about the concepts and techniques used to build recommender systems. Participants will learn about the role and applications of recommendation systems, the necessary data, and the different types of recommender systems. They will also gain practical experience in building and enhancing recommendation systems using statistical modeling and testing methods. This course is suitable for data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers, and covers topics such as market basket analysis, content-based and collaborative filtering approaches, and advanced recommender system techniques."
4,"The course ""Processing Big Data for Analytics"" is a 3-day program that teaches attendees how to structure big data projects for analytics, including technical aspects, model development, aggregation, and monitoring. The course is aimed at data analysts, data scientists, data engineers, and data product managers. Topics covered include structuring projects, designing a strategy for utilizing big data, evaluating data readiness, creating data pipelines, implementing feature engineering, and developing and monitoring models. The course will equip students with the skills to successfully manage and analyze large datasets for business insights."
5,"The assessment for the Graduate Certificate in Big Data Analytics consists of four components: Proposal (10%), Demo of Project (15%), Project Report (15%), and Individual Reflection Report (10%). There is also a written examination worth 50% of the total grade. To pass the practice module and be awarded the certificate, participants must receive a ""Competent"" grade in all three component modules (BDEA, RCS, PBDA) and achieve a minimum overall score of 50%. The Individual Reflection Report is a personal submission that reflects on the individual's role, contributions, and learnings from the project."
6,"The Practice Module in the MTech EBAC Grad Cert in Big Data Analytics program requires groups of four or five students to apply and practice the knowledge, techniques, and skills learned in all modules. The project should be sourced from the participants' own organizations or ideas using external data sources. The estimated time commitment for each group member is 10 days. The timeline for the Practice Module includes proposal submissions two weeks after the start of the first module, presentations one week after the written exam, and a final report due 10 days after the written exam."
