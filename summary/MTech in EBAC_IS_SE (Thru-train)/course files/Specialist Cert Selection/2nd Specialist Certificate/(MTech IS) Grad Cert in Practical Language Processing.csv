1,"The graduate certificate in Practical Language Processing focuses on developing skills in pre-processing textual data, categorizing documents, and extracting information from text. The course is divided into four modules, covering topics such as text analytics, sentiment mining, deep neural networks, and conversational UIs. By the end of the certificate, students will be able to build various language processing systems, including document categorization systems, information extraction systems, sentiment analysis systems, and chatbots. The four modules included in the certificate are Text Analytics, New Media and Sentiment Mining, Conversational UIs, and Text Processing using Machine Learning."
2,"This 3-day course, Text Analytics, teaches participants how to analyze large amounts of textual data to identify themes, patterns, and trends for improving business processes and decision making. It covers pre-processing textual data, categorization using classification, topic modelling, and clustering, and information extraction. The course is designed for business and IT professionals as well as data analysts and scientists who want to develop text analytics skills. Topics include applications of text analytics, the text mining process, preparing textual data, text classification and topic modelling, information extraction, and essential linguistics."

This 3-day course, titled ""New Media and Sentiment Mining,"" builds upon text mining knowledge and skills to teach participants how to design sentiment analysis systems and apply them to social media data. The course covers topics such as identifying where sentiment analysis can be applied, using open source libraries for sentiment analysis, designing systems for customer feedback and reviews, analyzing sentiment at a granular level, and summarizing and visualizing sentiment. The target audience for this course includes customer analysts and analysts looking to automate and extract insights from large amounts of textual data."
4,"-day course provides knowledge and practical skills for deep learning-based text processing in common industry tasks. Participants will learn to identify tasks, understand advanced NLP machine learning techniques, and implement NLP models. The course covers fundamental DNN and word embeddings, common DNN systems with NLP use cases, CNN, RNN, LSTM & GRU, sequence to sequence models, advanced DNN systems, attention, transformers, sentence/document representation, and transfer learning & pre-trained models. The target audience includes machine learning engineers, data scientists, and analysts."
5,"This 4-day course, Conversational UIs, teaches participants how to design and build systems that can interact with users using natural language. It covers the roles of conversational UIs in various applications, components and architectures of conversational interfaces, practical design methods and strategies, and traditional and machine learning approaches for development. It also includes topics such as conversation design, evaluating performance, understanding user utterances, speech recognition and synthesis, and speaker identification. The course is targeted towards developers, AI engineers, project managers, and solution architects of conversational systems."

The assessment for the Practical Language Processing Certificate consists of an open book exam worth 50% and a team-based project worth 50%. The exam will cover topics from all four courses, while the project will require students to apply techniques learned in the courses. This certificate is offered by the National University of Singapore."

The PLP Practice Module is a group project for 3 to 5 people where students propose their own business problem and dataset, preferably sponsored by an organization. The objective is to design, build, and evaluate a language processing system using public domain or sponsored data. The system must solve a business problem using language data and perform at least two text mining tasks, with one of them being implemented using a deep neural network. Bonus points can be earned for using self-collected data or tackling a new problem. The project must also include a component for sentiment mining or a conversational user interface. Approval from lecturers is required for the chosen business problem and dataset."
8,"The deliverables for the MTech IS Grad Cert in Practical Language Processing include a proposal document, presentation, system, report, and individual component. The proposal document must be approved by lecturers and the presentation carries a weightage of 5%. The system, which includes source codes and datasets, must have adequate documentation and a short demo video showcasing its functionalities (less than 5 minutes). The report, which carries a weightage of 15%, should be less than 20 pages and cover the business problem, datasets used, solution approaches, test results, conclusions, and references to publicly available libraries or source codes. The individual component, which carries a weightage of 10%, includes in-class assessments, an individual report on contribution to the"

The document discusses various past projects that have been completed as part of the MTech IS Grad Cert in Practical Language Processing. These projects include a movie recommendation bot that also provides sentiment analysis, sentiment analysis of YouTube video comments, a chatbot that generates poems, a coffee ordering bot, sentiment analysis of buyer comments on e-commerce websites, a QA bot for answering customer questions, and story generation in games based on user actions. These projects showcase the practical applications of language processing in various industries."
