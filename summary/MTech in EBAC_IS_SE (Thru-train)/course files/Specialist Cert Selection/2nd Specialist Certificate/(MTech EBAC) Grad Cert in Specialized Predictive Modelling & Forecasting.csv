1,"The document outlines the key components of the Graduate Certificate in Specialized Predictive Modelling & Forecasting, which aims to teach students advanced analytics skills such as predictive and prescriptive analytics, statistical and machine learning, deep learning, and decision science. The certificate consists of three modules: Complex Predictive Modelling & Forecasting, Product and Pricing Analytics, and Analytics for Commercial Excellence. Through these modules, students will learn how to build advanced statistical models, use predictive and prescriptive techniques for marketing and sales, and integrate analytics for commercial effectiveness in various industries and functions."
2,"The Complex Predictive Modelling & Forecasting course is a 5-day program that aims to provide students with the skills to solve complex prediction problems using advanced techniques. It covers topics such as advanced time series analysis, survival analysis/time to event modelling, and conjoint analysis. These techniques have a wide range of applications in various industries, including planning, inventory management, banking, manufacturing, health, and gaming. The course is designed to go beyond basic methodologies and equip students with the ability to handle real-world problems."
3,"This 4-day course, titled ""Product and Pricing Analytics"", combines predictive and prescriptive techniques from various disciplines such as statistics, economics, and machine learning to provide a practical understanding of using analytics for demand forecasting, commercial excellence, and portfolio management. Topics covered include experimental design for product innovation, econometric modelling and forecasting, prescriptive analytics, decision science for product and price optimization, and inventory planning and simulation. The course is offered by the National University of Singapore."
4,"The course ""Analytics for Commercial Excellence"" focuses on using predictive and prescriptive techniques to generate actionable insights for marketing, sales, and operations. It covers topics such as statistical and machine learning, mathematical optimization, marketing technology, and digital analytics. The course also includes modules on locational analytics for geomarketing and channel optimization, sales analytics for in-store operational excellence, and deep learning and AI for marketing optimization."
5,"The assessment component for the MTech EBAC Grad Cert in Specialized Predictive Modelling & Forecasting includes a practice module, a written examination, and a learning journal. The practice module consists of a proposal and a project report, with the project report being divided into a group portion and an individual learning journal. The demo presentation is also part of the practice module. The written examination carries the highest weight at 50%, with the total weight for all components being 100%. The learning journal is a personal reflection on the project and its journey, including individual contributions and learnings."
6,"The Practice Module of the Grad Cert in Specialized Predictive Modelling & Forecasting requires groups of four or five to apply the knowledge and skills they have learned from all modules. Each member is expected to spend around 10 days on the project, which can be sourced from their own organization or external data sources. The timeline for the Practice Module includes proposal submission two weeks after the start of the third module, presentations one week before the written exam, and a final report due one week after the written exam. The exact timeline may vary depending on the students' class schedules."
