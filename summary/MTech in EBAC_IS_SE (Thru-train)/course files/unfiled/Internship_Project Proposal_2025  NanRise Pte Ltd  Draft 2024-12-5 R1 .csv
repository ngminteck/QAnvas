1,"The MTech EBAC Internship Project Proposal outlines a collaborative pilot study between Tan Tock Seng Hospital and NanRise Pte Ltd to develop a framework for climate risk assessment in healthcare facilities in Singapore. The project aims to use AI-driven climate analytics and database management technologies to identify, assess, predict, and measure the risks of extreme heat and flooding on hospitals and healthcare services. The objectives include developing a framework for healthcare facilities, examining potential impacts of climate change on disease occurrences, and testing AI technologies. The project is in response to international research studies highlighting the need for hospitals to prepare for the effects of climate change."
2,"f. Develop and validate Machine Learning models to predict changes in service demands and other impacts from future climate change scenarios.

The internship project at NanRise Pte Ltd aims to develop a healthcare facilities adaptation plan by creating risk metrics for monitoring and assessment. The Proof of Concept (POC) stage will be completed in 2025, with full scale up in 2026. The students will assist with the POC by conducting literature reviews, identifying data sources, and building databases for climate change scenarios and city information modeling. They will also perform statistical analysis and develop Machine Learning models to predict the impact of climate change on healthcare services. The students may have the opportunity for conversion into full-time employment after the completion of the POC. The project job"
3,"The project proposal outlines the tasks and objectives for an internship at NanRise Pte Ltd. The intern will collaborate with the Machine Learning team to develop predictive models and algorithms for the project. This will involve conducting a literature review, developing a methodological framework, and undertaking exploratory analysis and modelling. The intern will also assist in setting up spatial and geo-statistical data visualization analytics. The project will focus on predicting occurrences of diseases, changes in service demands, and other impacts resulting from climate change and urban development scenarios. The intern should have technical skills in data sciences, including database management, SQL, statistical analysis, data processing, and data visualization. Prior experience in related domains and industries is preferred but not required."
4,"The internship project proposal is seeking four interns to join a data analysis and machine learning team at NanRise Pte Ltd. The interns will gain experience in spatial data analysis, including data collection, cleaning, transformation, and interpretation. They will also learn to use ArcGIS and other tools for geo-statistical analysis. The machine learning team will focus on using SQL and Python to develop and implement supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms for tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering. The interns will have access to government and non-government open datasets and will receive a stipend of SGD 1200 per month."
5,"The internship program for MTECH students at NanRise Pte Ltd will take place from mid/end March 2024 to mid/end August 2024, with a minimum duration of 20 weeks and a one-week break in May for exams. Students will be assigned to sponsor companies and will be considered full-time interns. Appendix A provides information on CPF and Employment Act terms, while Appendix B outlines the work pass exemption for foreign students."
6,"The Central Provident Fund (CPF) policy exempts registered NUS students (Singaporean/PRs only) undergoing a supported internship from CPF contributions. The Employment Act covers interns who are engaged under a contract of service and provides statutory benefits, such as a maximum of 8 working hours per day and 44 working hours per week. Overtime work is allowed with consent, up to a limit of 12 hours per day and 72 hours per month. Education institutions play a role in selecting suitable companies for internships and providing feedback to students. Foreign students enrolled in the full-time NUS-ISS Master of Technology programme are exempted from work pass requirements during their internship from 01 March 2025 to 30 Sep 202"
