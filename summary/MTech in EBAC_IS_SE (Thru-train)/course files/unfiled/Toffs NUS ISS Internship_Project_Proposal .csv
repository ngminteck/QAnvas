1,"work on developing and implementing machine learning algorithms to enhance the DDoS mitigation platform

The document outlines the guidelines for a Master of Technology internship project proposal. The project title is ""Agentic AI for Toffs DDoS Mitigation Platform"" and it requires 2 interns from the Enterprise Business Analytics or Artificial Intelligence Systems programs. The interns should have knowledge of machine learning and AI, proficiency in SQL and Python, and experience with building ML/AI systems and managing cloud platforms. A stipend of $1500 is available and the sponsor/client is Toffs Technologies Pte Ltd. The company project supervisor is Chew Choo Ling and the background/aims/objectives of the project are to enhance the DDoS mitigation platform with machine learning algorithms."
2,"The project is to develop and deploy AI models and systems in collaboration with an appointed AI vendor to detect and mitigate against distributed botnet attacks. The key responsibilities include data gathering, analysis, preprocessing, and manipulation, as well as testing and evaluation of AI models. The desired outcome is to develop an efficient model for real-time analysis of CDN attack logs and implement defense mechanisms via APIs on the Toffs platform. The resource requirements include Graylog, nginx, AWS, and mongodb. The project aims to process CDN logs in real-time, train the model to identify attack requests, identify distributed bots and attack methods, implement defense mechanisms, and assess the effectiveness of the defense through availability and response time of the attacked domain. The ultimate goal is to have an"
3,"The project guidelines document will serve as a reference for the Toffs NUS ISS Internship Project. It will include the project overview, objectives, scope, timeline, and key deliverables. The document will also outline the roles and responsibilities of the project team members, as well as the project management approach and communication plan. Additionally, the document will provide guidelines for filing and organizing project documents, such as meeting minutes, progress reports, and presentations. The project guidelines document will be regularly updated and reviewed by the project manager to ensure smooth and efficient project execution."
4,"This document provides guidelines for the filing of project-related documents for the Toffs NUS ISS Internship Programme. It includes a reference number for internal use, the name of the programme, project number, and student batch. The document also indicates whether the project has been accepted, rejected, or put on hold, as well as the names of the students and advisor assigned to the project."
