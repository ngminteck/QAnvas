Page 11, Proposal for Internship/Capstone Project should include the following content . It should be sufficiently detailed so that the breadth and complexity of the solution can be gauged .
Page 12, A leading manufacturing company wishes to develop a platform to manage their operations . They wish to build a platform where suppliers and logistics partners can add value to their platform by providing online services . This requires development of useful APIs at the right granularity
Page 13," A mature tech start-up company wishes to productizeits successful security software . The existing product needs to be re-engineered to make it maintainable, extensible and scalable . Robust security controls have to be incorporated in the"
Page 14, A transport operator wishes to undertake building a smart system capable of optimising the deployment of public transports . It requires monitoring the traffic conditions and predicting the number of vehicles to be deployed at different times of the day in different regions of the city
Page 15, A big bank wishes to engineer its multi-channel data streams for analytics purposes . A system that can engineer Data Lakes needs to be built . The engineered system must be demonstrated by performing suitable data visualisation and analytics .
Page 16, The presentation and project deliverables would be graded by a team of NUS-ISS lecturers . The participant must attain a minimum overall score of 50% (e.g. Grade C) to pass the Internship/Capstone
Overall Summary, A minimum of 45 days of effort by each participant . Project spans areas covered by a few certificates with some added value . Scope of work focuses on the architecting of the solution as well as the building of a significant slice of the functionality
