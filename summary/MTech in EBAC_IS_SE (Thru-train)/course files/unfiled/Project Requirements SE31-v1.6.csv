3,"The Internship/Capstone Project for the MTech Software Engineering degree aims to allow students to apply their knowledge and skills in building secure and scalable smart systems, products, and platforms. The project should also showcase the student's mastery of the subject matter and their ability to be an efficient practitioner. Additionally, the project should provide value through aspects such as machine learning, analytics, safety-criticality, real-timeliness, fault tolerance, hardware integration, and robotic and vision technology. The project also serves as an opportunity for sponsoring organizations to experience and evaluate new technologies, techniques, and methods."
4,"The internship/capstone project requires a minimum of 45 days of effort from each participant and covers multiple areas with added value. The scope of work includes architecting the solution and building a significant portion of its functionality, with a focus on catering to multiple releases. The constructed software should prioritize MVP first and can target either an off-site project or an on-site internship. The project has a duration of 8 months for part-time participants and 20 weeks (5 months) for full-time participants, with a scheduled start date of March 2024. The team may start informally earlier if feasible, but the project should not end earlier."
5,"The project will be conducted in 3 phases, following an incremental and iterative approach with agile practices. Each phase can be divided into multiple sprints, with the duration of each sprint decided by the student team and/or the company sponsor. The typical part-time schedule for each phase is 4 weeks with 1 sprint, while the full-time schedule is 2 weeks with 1 sprint. The tasks for each phase include creating a product/platform roadmap, designing a solution architecture, and creating a product/platform backlog. The second and third phases also involve tasks such as sprint planning, software design, and testing."
6,"The document outlines the key milestones for the ATA/SWE-CPST/Project Requirements, a capstone/internship project. The project begins with a briefing on the requirements, conduct, and assessment for the participants. Proposals are then submitted and reviewed by lecturers, with revisions if necessary. The project is conducted over a period of 6 months, with fortnightly progress reports submitted and consultations with lecturers. Two project presentations are tentatively scheduled, one after Phase 1 and another after Phase 2. The project concludes with the submission of a final project report, incorporating feedback from the presentations."
7,"The TalentConnectKey Steps Quick Guide for NUS-ISS students outlines three main steps to access the platform and view available opportunities. First, students must login to TalentConnect using the provided link. Then, they should go to the My Experiential Learning Record section. Finally, students should select the NUS-ISS programme they are interested in to view a list of posted opportunities. This process allows students to easily access and explore experiential learning opportunities related to their chosen NUS-ISS programme."
8,"The detailed project agenda for the ATA/SWE-CPST project includes two phases with specific deliverables and tasks. In Phase 0, the team will determine the product/platform roadmap and backlog, create the initial solution architecture, and potentially conduct a feasibility study and prototyping. In Phase 1, the team will conduct regular sprint activities, design critical user stories and the DevOps pipeline, construct the solution for user stories, create and test test cases, and update the product/platform roadmap and solution architecture. Phase 2 will have the same tasks as Phase 1."
9,"The progress report for the internship/capstone project must be submitted periodically to NUS-ISS through Canvas. For part-time students, the report is due monthly starting on 12 Apr 2024, while full-time students must submit it fortnightly starting on 01 Apr 2024. The report should include the project title, date, summary of work done, list of tasks conducted since the last report, effort expended by each member, problems encountered, and a plan for the next reporting duration. Part-time students should plan for one month, while full-time students should plan for a fortnight."
10,"Participants in the SE31 program are required to form groups of 4-5 members by signing up on Canvas. The Canvas module will be available at the beginning of the semester in Jan/Feb 2024. It is recommended that teams have members with different specialist certificates. Participants are encouraged to find suitable projects from their own organizations, their own ideas, or from other approved sources. NUS-ISS will also provide projects from its contacts, and students can discuss further with the sponsors in their teams. NUS-ISS will offer guidance by reviewing the project's suitability."
11,"The proposal for the Internship/Capstone Project should be submitted to Darryl by the specified deadline for evaluation by NUS-ISS. An earlier submission and approval will allow for an earlier start of the project. The proposal should include a project title, team members, project sponsor, aims/objectives, requirements overview, resource requirements, and methods and standards. A template document is provided for the proposal and it should be detailed enough to show the complexity and value-add aspects of the solution. Any constraints on hardware, software, and development process should also be highlighted."
12,"A leading manufacturing company wants to create a platform for managing their operations and integrating their suppliers and logistics partners. The platform should have useful APIs and intelligent components, and be able to connect with other platforms like banks. The success criteria includes developing the platform, deploying it successfully, and using modern technology and frameworks."
13,"A tech start-up company is looking to turn their successful security software into a marketable product. They need help developing a digital product strategy and roadmap, and re-engineering their existing product to make it maintainable, extensible, and scalable. The project will involve performing an impact analysis on the current system, re-architecting and re-engineering it, and incorporating robust security controls. The end result should be a software system that follows good engineering practices and can continue to evolve as a product."
14,"The transport operator wants to build a smart system to optimize the deployment of public transports by monitoring traffic conditions and predicting the number of vehicles needed in different regions. The system should be scalable and extensible to work in both large and small cities, and be able to accommodate specialized vehicles like ambulances and fire engines. The deliverables include a well-architected smart system that uses sensor data from lamp posts and vehicles, utilizes appropriate smart libraries and APIs, and provides real-time responses and analysis. The system should also have an intuitive and user-friendly interface."
15,"The project involves engineering a system for a big bank to analyze real-time data from various channels, including mobile devices and social media, for business improvement and competitiveness. The data is a mix of structured and unstructured, and the system must be able to create Data Lakes. The deliverables include making the data usable, building data pipelines, and demonstrating the system through data visualization and analytics. The success criteria include successfully engineering Big Data and employing techniques for ingestion, transformation, and insight gaining."
16,"The assessment for the Internship/Capstone Project consists of four components: first presentation (10%), second presentation (10%), project deliverables (45%), and client feedback (15%). Peer assessments also contribute to the overall grade (20%). The participant must achieve a minimum overall score of 50% to pass the project and a minimum overall score of 60% to be awarded a Master of Technology degree. The grading will be done by a team of NUS-ISS lecturers."
