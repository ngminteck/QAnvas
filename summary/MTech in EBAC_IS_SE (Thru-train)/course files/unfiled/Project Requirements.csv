Page 1, The National University of Singapore is developing a software engineering project called CAPSTONE . The project will be completed at the end of the year 2022 .
Page 2, Agenda: To brief the participants of MTech SE on the requirements of the capstone project . Objectives: To assess the requirements and conduct the project as a project project .
Page 3," Capstone Project aims to enable students to bring together all the topics they have studied and apply the tools, techniques and methods to build smart systems, products and platforms that are secure and scalable . Added value in some aspects like machine learning,"
Page 4, The internship will start in Mar 2023. The Capstone Project requires a minimum of 45 days of effort by each participant .
Page 5," Approach for Project Conduct is 3-phased appro ach with agile practices . Sprint duration is decided by the student team and/or the company sponsor . Sprint Planning, Sprint Conduct, Software Design, DevOps Pipeline Design,"
Page 6, The participants are briefed on the requirements and assessment of the capstone project . The lecturers provide the review comments . The participants conduct their projects and consult  the lecturers on issues .
