1,"The document provides a briefing on the project requirements for the MTech. Software Engineering capstone project. It is presented by Darryl Ng and outlines the key points for the project, including the total number of slides (15) and the copyright information for the National University of Singapore. It also includes contact information for Darryl Ng's email address."
2,"The agenda for the MTech SE capstone project briefing includes objectives, topics, and key components such as project milestones, progress reports, and project selection. The objectives of the capstone project and the requirements for its completion will be discussed, as well as the approach for conducting the project. Typical examples of capstone projects and the assessment process will also be covered. The briefing aims to inform participants of the necessary information for successful completion of the capstone project."
3,"The objectives of the Capstone Project are to allow students to apply the tools, techniques, and methods they have learned to build smart systems, products, and platforms that are secure and scalable. The project should also incorporate aspects such as machine learning, analytics, safety-criticality, real-timeliness, fault tolerance, hardware integration, robotic and vision. It serves as a way for students to showcase their mastery of the subject and their ability to be efficient practitioners. Additionally, the project provides an opportunity for sponsoring organizations to experience and evaluate new technologies, techniques, and methods. It is the final component of the MTech Software Engineering degree."
4,"The Capstone Project requires a minimum of 45 days of effort from each participant and will cover multiple areas. The focus will be on architecting the solution and building a significant portion of its functionality, with consideration for future releases. The constructed software should target MVP first and can be completed either through an on-site internship or an off-site project. The duration of the project is 8 months for part-time participants and 20 weeks (5 months) for full-time participants, with a scheduled start date of March 2023. The internship or project should not end before August 2023."
5,"The project will be conducted in three phases, with each phase being incremental and iterative, using agile practices. Each phase can be divided into multiple sprints, with the duration of each sprint being determined by the student team and/or the company sponsor. The typical part-time schedule for Phase 0 is 4 weeks with 1 sprint, while the full-time schedule is 2 weeks with 1 sprint. Tasks for this phase include creating a product/platform roadmap, solution architecture, and product/platform backlog. Phase 1 and 2 have a typical part-time schedule of 14 weeks with a few sprints and a full-time schedule of 9 weeks with a few sprints. Tasks for these phases include sprint planning, software design, devOps"
6,"The project milestones for the ATA/SWE-CPST capstone project include a project briefing on November 21, 2022, proposal submission by January 10, 2023, proposal review on January 20, 2023, project conduct from March 20 to October 31, 2023, first project presentation on June 30, 2023, second project presentation on November 3, 2023, and report submission on November 15, 2023. Participants will receive guidance and feedback from lecturers throughout the project, and are expected to submit progress reports and a final project report."
7,"The document outlines the deliverables and tasks for each phase of the project, including a product/platform roadmap, backlog, solution architecture, and sprint activities. The first phase involves determining the roadmap, eliciting user stories and constraints, and crafting the initial architecture. The second phase includes regular sprint activities, designing critical user stories and the DevOps pipeline, constructing the solution, and updating the roadmap and architecture. The third phase is the same as the second."
8,"The progress report for the Capstone Project should be submitted to Canvas periodically for review by ISS. For part-time students, the report is due monthly starting on April 1, 2023, while full-time students must submit the report fortnightly starting on March 15, 2023. The report should include the project title, date, summary of work done, list of tasks conducted since the last report, effort expended by each member, problems encountered, and a plan for the next reporting duration."
9,"The selection of the Capstone Project involves forming a group of 4-5 members through signing up on Canvas. The module may not be available until the beginning of the semester in January 2023. It is beneficial for teams to have members with different specialist certificates. Participants are encouraged to find suitable projects from their own organizations, personal ideas, or approved sources. ISS will also provide potential projects from their contacts and students must discuss with the sponsors in their team. ISS will review the project's suitability and provide guidance."
10,"The proposal for the Capstone Project must be submitted to Darryl by the deadline for evaluation by ISS. An earlier submission and approval will allow for an earlier start to the project. The proposal should include a project title, names of project members, sponsor's name and contact information, aims/objectives, an overview of the requirements and value-add aspects, resource requirements, and methods and standards. The proposal should be 1-2 pages long and a template document is provided. The solution may be constrained to specific hardware, software, or engineering methods and standards."
11,"A manufacturing company wants to create a platform to manage their operations and involve their suppliers and logistics partners in providing online services. This will require the development of APIs and a platform ecosystem. The project deliverables include a platform with reusable intelligent components and services, useful APIs for partners, and successful deployment. The project will use state-of-the-art technology and frameworks such as Cloud and Microservices."
12,"A tech start-up company wants to turn their successful security software into a marketable product. They need to develop a digital product strategy and roadmap, and re-engineer their existing product to make it maintainable, extensible, and scalable. The new product must also have robust security controls and exhibit good software engineering practices. The project will involve impact analysis, re-architecting and re-engineering the existing system, and incorporating appropriate security controls. The success criteria will be a product that aligns with the company's strategy and roadmap, and meets high standards of maintainability, extensibility, and security."
13,"The project aims to create a smart system for a transport operator that can optimize the deployment of public transports by monitoring traffic conditions and predicting the number of vehicles needed at different times and regions. The system will use sensor data from lamp posts and vehicles, and should be scalable for use in both large and small cities. It should also be able to add specialized vehicles like ambulances and fire engines. The deliverables include a well-architected system with smart libraries and APIs, real-time responses and analysis, and an intuitive user interface."
14,"The capstone project involves engineering multi-channel data streams for a big bank to improve their business and stay competitive. The data is collected in real time from mobile devices, social media feeds, and other channels and is a mix of structured and unstructured data. The goal is to build a system that can engineer Data Lakes and make real-time data streams usable. The deliverables include building data pipelines using techniques such as ingestion, transformation, and insight gaining, as well as demonstrating the engineered system through data visualization and analytics. The success criteria is to improve the bank's use of big data and make it more efficient."
15,"The assessment for the Capstone Project is divided into five components: First Presentation (10%), Second Presentation (10%), Project Deliverables (45%), Client Feedback (15%), and Peer Assessments (20%). These will be graded by a team of ISS lecturers and a minimum overall score of 50% is required to pass the project. In order to be awarded a Master of Technology degree, a minimum overall score of 60% across all qualifying certificates and the capstone project is necessary."
