1,"The MTech EBAC Internship Project Proposal outlines a collaborative pilot study between NanRise Pte Ltd and Tan Tock Seng Hospital in Singapore. The project aims to develop a framework for climate risk assessment in healthcare facilities, with a focus on the physical impacts on buildings and services. It will also examine the potential impacts of climate change on disease occurrences and utilize AI technology for risk identification and prediction. The project is in response to the growing concern over the effects of climate change on hospitals and healthcare services."
2,"The internship project proposal for NanRise Pte Ltd involves developing a healthcare facilities adaptation plan and risk metrics for monitoring and assessment. The Proof of Concept (POC) stage will be completed in 2025 and full scale up is planned for 2026. The students will assist in the POC and have the opportunity for conversion into full-time team members. The scope of work for the students includes conducting literature reviews, identifying data sources, developing climate and city information databases, and conducting statistical analysis. They will also work in two technical teams, one focusing on city information modelling and data analysis and the other on developing databases and conducting statistical analysis."
3,"The internship project proposal outlines the tasks and skills required for a project at NanRise Pte Ltd. The project involves setting up spatial and geo-statistical data visualization analytics for predictive findings, as well as conducting literature review and assisting in the development of a methodological framework for Machine Learning predictive models. The intern will also undertake exploratory analysis and modelling, set up training and evaluation datasets, and develop, train, validate, and evaluate AI predictive models for predicting occurrences of diseases resulting from climate change and urban development. Technical skills required include data science skills, database management, SQL, statistical analysis, data processing and visualization, and web scraping. Prior experience in related domains or industries is preferred but not required."
4,"The internship project at NanRise Pte Ltd in 2025 will focus on developing spatial data analysis and machine learning skills for projects at various scales, including cities, districts, buildings, and neighborhoods. This will involve data collection, cleaning, transformation, analysis, interpretation, and projection/forecasting. The preferred tool for spatial/geo-statistical analysis is ArcGIS. Machine learning skills required for the project include SQL, Python, and the development and use of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Interns will also be trained in identifying and accessing relevant government and non-government open datasets globally. A total of four interns will be hired, with two working on the data"
5,"This section outlines the internship period for MTECH interns at NanRise Pte Ltd, which will run from mid/end March 2024 to mid/end August 2024, with a minimum of 20 weeks and a one-week break in May for exams. The interns will be full-time and attached to sponsor companies, and the terms of employment and work pass exemptions for foreign students can be found in Appendices A and B, respectively."
6,"The document discusses the Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution and Employment Act policies for NUS students undergoing internships. According to CPF, registered NUS students are exempt from CPF contributions during their internships. The Employment Act covers interns and mandates that they should not work more than 8 hours a day or 44 hours a week, with overtime pay and rest days provided. Education institutions are responsible for selecting suitable companies for internships and providing guidance to students. Foreign students enrolled in the NUS-ISS Master of Technology program are exempt from work pass requirements during their internship."
