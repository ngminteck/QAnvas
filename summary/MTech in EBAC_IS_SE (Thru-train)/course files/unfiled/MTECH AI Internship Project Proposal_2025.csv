1,"The document outlines an internship project proposal for MTech students, targeting those in the Software Engineering, Intelligent Systems, Enterprise Business Analytics, and Systems Analysis programs. The project, to be carried out at Schaeffler (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., involves using Large Language Models to interact with robots in a conversational manner. The project requires strong programming skills in Python and/or C++, as well as experience with speech processing, NLP, or computer vision. One intern is needed for the project, with a stipend of SGD 1800 per month. The aim of the project is to explore open-source multimodal models for understanding images and text together."
2,"The project aims to integrate speech recognition and cognitive reasoning agents for context-aware robotic decision-making. The desired outcome includes researching and implementing state-of-the-art speech recognition models, developing wake word detection and real-time speech-to-text solutions for noisy environments, exploring AI reasoning frameworks for contextual decision-making, implementing multimodal fusion techniques, and creating proof-of-concept applications for AI-powered robotic interactions. The internship period for MTECH students will be from March 2025 to August 2025, while for GDipSA students it will be from March 2025 to end July/August 2025. The project should include at least 60% coding assignments and students will be attached to sponsor companies as full-time interns."

The document outlines the terms and conditions for a full-time internship for students, including information on CPF contributions and the Employment Act. Interns are exempt from CPF contributions, but are protected under the Employment Act and should not be required to work more than 8 hours a day or 44 hours a week. Overtime work must be compensated and interns should be given one rest day per week. Education institutions are responsible for selecting suitable companies and briefing students on their working arrangements. They also assess the student's performance based on feedback from both the student and the company."
4,"The NUS-ISS Master of Technology student internship is a crucial component of the degree program and is graded as a module. As such, foreign students enrolled in the full-time program are exempted from work pass requirements only during their internship. Both the education institution and employer are expected to provide regular feedback to students, and students can also provide their feedback to continually improve the internship experience. This information can be found on the Ministry of Manpower website."
