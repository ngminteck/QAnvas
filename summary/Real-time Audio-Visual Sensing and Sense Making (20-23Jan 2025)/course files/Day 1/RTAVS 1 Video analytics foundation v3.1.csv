9,The document discusses the importance of real-time video analytics for maximum situational awareness and recommends displaying 5 seconds of pre-alarm footage and 10 seconds of post-alarm footage automatically. This function is referenced in the UK Centre for Protection of National Infrastructure's CCTV for CNI Perimeter Security guidance. Real-time mode involves analyzing each frame of the video stream as it is captured and generating alarms for pre-defined triggers. Forensic mode allows for searching through recorded video for triggers or points where alerts have been generated. This is further explained in the Singapore video analytics within video surveillance systems document.
10,"Real-time in the perceptual sense refers to the near instantaneous response of a computer device to an input by a human user. This is described as the result of processing appearing effectively 'instantaneously' in a perceptual sense. In contrast, real-time in the signal processing sense refers to completing processing within the allowable or available time between samples. This is often used in the context of digital image and video processing, as well as in real-time digital signal processing based on the TMS320C6000."
11,"This section provides an overview of video analytics, including the basics of video data modelling and motion feature representation. It also covers object tracking in videos, specifically single object tracking (SOT) and multiple objects tracking (MOT)."
12,"This section explains the basics of video analytics by defining a video as a sequence of frames captured over time. Each frame contains data (intensity) that is a function of space and time. The frame resolution refers to the dimension of each frame, while the frame rate measures the number of frames captured per second. This information is important for understanding how video analytics processes and analyzes video data."
13,"Video analytics is becoming increasingly important in surveillance systems, as it allows for more efficient and accurate detection of events such as abandoned objects, crowd or traffic jams. This is because video provides more information compared to static images, such as object motion and scene changes over time. It also enables the tracking of object trajectories, which is essential for recognizing events. A survey and comparison of abandoned object detection in video surveillance showed that video analytics is superior to static image analysis in terms of accuracy and efficiency."
14,"The document discusses different motion scenarios in video analytics. These include static camera with a moving scene, moving camera with a static scene, moving camera with a moving scene, and static camera with a moving scene and changing lighting conditions. These scenarios pose different challenges for video analytics algorithms and require different approaches for accurate detection and tracking. It is important for video analytics systems to be able to handle these scenarios effectively in order to provide reliable results."
15,"The motion vector is a 2D representation of the displacement between a reference image and a target image. This can be set in either direction, with the right image as the target and the left image as the reference."
16,"The document discusses different methods of motion representation in video analytics. These include block-based, frame-based, pixel-based, and region-based approaches. Block-based representation divides the frame into blocks and assigns a constant motion vector to each block. Frame-based representation uses global parameters, such as translation, to represent the entire motion field. Pixel-based representation assigns one motion vector to each pixel position. Region-based representation divides the frame into regions and represents each region with an object that has consistent motion."
17,The block-based motion feature in video analytics involves assuming that all pixels in a block have the same motion and searching for motion parameters for each block independently. This is done by comparing the current frame to the previous frame and finding the best matched block center. The size of each image is 10x8 pixels and each block is 3x3 pixels. The motion vectors can be calculated using either the current-previous or previous-current method.
18,"The document discusses the block-based motion feature in video analytics. It explains two searching strategies: full (slow) search and sub-optimal (fast) search, such as the three-step search. The searching criterion involves calculating the difference between the reference image (block) and the target image (block), using methods like mean square error (MSE). The formula for MSE is also provided, involving the size of the blocks and their respective pixel values."
19,"The document discusses the use of block-based motion feature for video analytics. It explains that the feature allows for both integer and sub-pixel precision in searching for motion. This is achieved through image interpolation, which creates virtual pixels at sub-pixel locations. The size of each block is 3 x 3 pixels, and the motion vector is calculated by comparing the current frame to the previous frame. The best matched block center in the previous frame is determined and used to calculate the motion vector."
20,"Optical flow is the estimation of motion vectors at each pixel location between two subsequent frames in a video. It is represented by [u, v] and is calculated using the pixel coordinates, image intensities, and frame index. The goal of optical flow is to determine the apparent motion of brightness patterns in an image."
21,"Optical flow is a method used to estimate the motion of objects in a video. It is based on two key principles: brightness constancy, which states that the brightness of an object remains the same even as it moves, and small motion, which means that the motion of an object changes gradually over time. This method is useful for tracking objects and detecting changes in a video."
22,"Optical flow calculation is a technique used in video analytics to estimate the movement of objects in a video. It is based on the principles of brightness constancy and small motion, which use the Taylor series expansion of image intensity to calculate the flow. The spatial coherence constraint assumes that neighboring pixels have similar motion, and uses a 5x5 window to calculate the flow at 25 pixel locations."
23,"The document discusses optical flow calculation, specifically the spatial coherence constraint which assumes that neighboring pixels have the same motion vectors. This results in a system of equations that can be solved to determine the motion vector for each pixel. Other gradient calculation methods can also be used for this process."
24,"The document discusses a method for estimating optical flow, or the apparent motion of objects in a sequence of images, using a pyramid of images at different levels. The process involves calculating optical flow at each level and then warping the images to improve the accuracy of the estimation. This method is based on an iterative image registration technique and can fail if two assumptions are not met."
25,"Optical flow can fail when trying to differentiate between camera motion, lighting change, and object motion. Flat regions of an image cannot be determined from optical flow. The least squares solution for 𝐝𝐝 is given by 𝐀𝐀𝑇𝑇𝐀𝐀 𝐝𝐝 = 𝐀𝐀𝑇𝑇𝐛𝐛, but it is only solvable if 𝐀𝐀𝑇𝑇𝐀𝐀 is invertible, not too small due to noise, and has eigenvalues that are not too small. This solution is possible for texture image regions, but not for flat"
26,"The document discusses the use of supervised learning for optical flow, specifically using FlowNetSimple and FlowNetCorr. FlowNetSimple involves stacking two images and feeding them into the network, while FlowNetCorr first produces representations of the images separately and then combines them in a ""correlation layer"" to learn a higher representation. The reference for this approach is the paper ""FlowNet: Learning Optical Flow with Convolutional Networks"" from ICCV 2015."
27,"This section discusses the use of supervised learning for optical flow, specifically using a technique called FlowNet. This involves calculating the dot product between pair-wise feature vectors in a correlation layer. The reference for this technique is a paper from ICCV 2015."
28,"The MotionNet algorithm is a self-supervised learning approach for optical flow, which aims to generate the flow field that can reconstruct one frame from another. It uses a fully convolutional network with a contracting and expanding part, and the loss function is based on minimizing the photometric error between the original and reconstructed frames. This method is based on the Hidden two-stream convolutional networks for action recognition and was presented at ACCV 2018."
29,"The document discusses the various uses of motion features in video analytics, including identifying and segmenting objects based on motion cues, recognizing events and activities, and generating motion-based videos. It also provides links to examples and references for further information."
30,"The document introduces the concept of video analytics and its fundamentals, including video data modeling and motion feature representation. It also discusses object tracking in videos, specifically single object tracking (SOT) and multiple objects tracking (MOT)."
31,"Detection and tracking are two different methods used in video analytics. Detection is applied on a static image or each frame of a sequence, while tracking is applied on a sequence of images. Detection relies on a pre-trained detector for known objects, while tracking can handle unknown objects in real-time. Detection can only provide the position of objects, while tracking can also preserve their identity and track their trajectory. However, detection cannot handle occluded objects, while tracking can make assumptions to handle them."
32,"The document discusses the challenges that arise in tracking objects using video analytics. These challenges include changes in illumination, rotation of objects, low-resolution footage, heavy occlusions, abrupt motions, and scale changes. Dealing with these challenges is essential for accurate and efficient tracking of objects in video footage."
33,"Object tracking involves several key components, including initializing the target state, learning the object's visual appearance, observing features of candidate regions, evaluating motion to identify the target's location, and updating the object's representation as it may change during tracking. The initial state of the target can be defined manually or automatically detected, and the object's appearance must be learned. The search image is evaluated to determine the target's location, and the object's representation is updated as needed."
34,"The document discusses a tracking benchmark for object tracking in video analytics. The benchmark can be found on GitHub and is used to evaluate the performance of different tracking algorithms. It is based on a dataset containing various video sequences with ground truth annotations. The benchmark includes metrics such as tracking accuracy and speed, and can be used to compare the performance of different tracking algorithms."
35,Template matching is a method used to find a specific object in an image by comparing a template of the object to the image. It involves sliding a patch of the image over the template and calculating a matching score at each position. The highest score indicates the position of the object in the image. This method is based on color similarity and uses the cv2.TM_SQDIFF method to calculate the score.
36,"Template matching is a method used in video analytics to locate a target object in a frame by comparing it to a specified template. This is done through cross correlation, where the function slides through the image and compares a patch of the same size as the template against the template itself. The result is stored and normalized before calculating the score at each position. The highest score indicates the position of the tracked object in the frame. This method is implemented using the cv2.TM_CCORR function."
37,"Template matching is a technique used in video analytics to locate objects in a video frame by comparing it to a template image. However, this method can be time-consuming and not robust to changes in lighting. To address these challenges, a more efficient approach is to perform the correlation calculation only in a specific search region rather than the entire image. Additionally, instead of relying on a single template, an optimized filter can be learned based on a set of templates to improve accuracy. This approach is outlined in a reference paper and involves using a response map to identify the best matching location in the search region."
38,"The correlation filter technique, specifically MOSSE and KCF, is used to improve object tracking in video analytics. The idea is to learn an optimized filter that produces a strong peak at the object's location and low values elsewhere. MOSSE minimizes the squared error between the correlation output and desired output, while KCF introduces regularization to the cost function. This technique involves applying affine transformations to generate pairs of synthetic input and response images, which are used to calculate the optimized filter. The reference for this technique is the paper ""Visual object tracking using adaptive correlation filters"" from CVPR 2010."
39,"The document discusses the use of correlation filters, specifically MOSSE and KCF, in video analytics. These filters are used to track moving targets by generating a desired response map and applying an affine transform to create more synthetic search region images and response maps. The peak in the response map indicates the position of the tracked target. The filter is trained by minimizing the difference between the synthetic search region images and response maps. This process involves both inference and training."
40,"The CNN-based tracker, GOTURN, is a generic object tracking system that uses regression networks to predict the coordinates of an object in a current frame based on a search region and target from the previous frame. It requires offline annotated data and uses a bank of convolutional layers and fully connected layers to process input frames. The output layer contains four nodes representing the top and bottom points of the bounding box. The tracker assumes smooth ""slow"" motion and the object cannot be far from its previous location."
41,"The CNN-based tracker, SiamFC, takes a target and a search region as input and outputs a score map. The maximum score relative to the center of the map gives the displacement of the target in the next frame. This method requires offline annotated data and uses a fully-convolutional Siamese network. The output is a scalar-valued score map based on the search image. The ground truth score maps are automatically generated with values of 1 at pixel locations near the target and 0 elsewhere. This method was presented in the ECCV 2016 conference."
42,"The Transformer-based tracker, named TransT, utilizes a Siamese-like feature extraction backbone and an attention-based fusion mechanism. It also includes classification and regression heads. This tracker was presented in the CVPR 2021 conference and can be referenced in the arxiv.org/abs/[REDACTED_PHONE] document. The feature extraction backbone is represented by a CNN and the classification and regression heads are used for classification and regression tasks."
43,"The Transformer-based tracker, TrackerVit, is a one-stream framework for tracking that utilizes joint feature learning and relation modeling. It uses a template image and a search region image to generate a classification score map, offset map, and box size map. These maps are used to predict the location and size of the target object in the search region. The framework is based on a Transformer architecture and has shown promising results in tracking tasks."
44,"This section provides an overview of video analytics, including the fundamentals of video data modelling and motion feature representation. It also discusses object tracking in videos, specifically single object tracking (SOT) and multiple objects tracking (MOT)."
45,"The document discusses the concept of multiple object tracking and presents the idea of using detection and association to solve the problem. This approach involves using an object detector to localize objects in each frame and then associating them between frames. The example of DEEPSORT, a simple online real-time tracking system, is provided to illustrate this concept. This system uses a deep learning-based detector for detection and a CNN-based appearance feature for association. The reference for this approach is Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric, published in ICIP 2017."
46,"The Association: Location model in RTAVS uses the concept of location similarity to track objects in video frames. This is done by comparing the bounding box of the detected object in the current frame with the bounding box of the same object in the previous frame. If there is an overlap between the two boxes, the Intersection over Union (IOU) is calculated. If there is no overlap, the Euclidean distance between the centers of the boxes is calculated. This model can be visualized using three object trackers (orange, red, and blue) with historical trajectories and four objects (black) detected in the current frame."
47,"The motion model association in video analytics involves comparing the location of a detected object in the current frame with its predicted position based on its historical trajectory. This is done using the state of the object, which includes its position, width, height, and velocity, and observations from previous frames. The goal is to predict the most likely state of the object based on all historical observations, using techniques such as Kalman filter or particle filter. An example is given with three object trackers and four detected objects in the current frame."
48,"The document discusses the concept of association in visual object tracking, specifically focusing on the appearance model. It mentions the use of hand-crafted features and CNN features for visual representations, and techniques such as cross correlation and SiamFC for similarity evaluation. It also references a survey on appearance models in visual object tracking. An example is provided with three object trackers and four objects detected in the current frame."
49,"The document discusses the process of association in video analytics, specifically in matching objects between two consecutive frames. This is done by building a table of match scores for all objects in the previous and current frame. The match scores are based on factors such as location, motion, and appearance. The goal is to choose a 1-1 correspondence that maximizes the sum of match scores, which can be done using methods such as the Hungarian algorithm."
50,"Object tracking is a practical issue in video analytics, and there are several considerations to keep in mind. These include how to initialize the object in the first frame, which can be done manually or with an object detector. Unfortunately, there is no ImageNet dataset available for training an object tracker, but this may not be necessary as the tracker should be general enough to handle different types of objects. Speed is also a crucial requirement for a real-time tracker."
51,"The document discusses the use of video analytics for surveillance purposes, specifically in the examples of motion analysis for indoor retail surveillance and object tracking for outdoor traffic monitoring. It explains how these techniques can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of surveillance systems, and provides a step-by-step guide for implementing them. The document also emphasizes the importance of considering privacy and ethical concerns when using video analytics in surveillance."
