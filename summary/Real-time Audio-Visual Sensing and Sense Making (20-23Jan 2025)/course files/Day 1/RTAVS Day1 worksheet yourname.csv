10,"The question asks how to differentiate between active and inactive fish in a fish tank using a top-down camera. Good water quality leads to fish exploring a large area, while bad water quality restricts their movement. The initial idea is to track each fish in a recorded video clip, but as this is a new fish species with no pre-collected images, a new method is needed. One suggestion is to analyze the video clip using features such as the number of fish present and their speed of movement. This method does not require additional training images for the new fish species."
11,"The demonstration will use three frames from each video clip, with two distinct types of behavior: active, where the fishes explore a large area in the tank, and not active, where they explore only a limited portion of the tank."
