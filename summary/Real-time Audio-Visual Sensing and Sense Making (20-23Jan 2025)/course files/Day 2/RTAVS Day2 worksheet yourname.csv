10,"The document compares two hand wash recognition solutions: a camera-based solution and a wearable device solution. The camera-based solution uses a camera to detect hand movements and recognize hand washing actions, while the wearable device solution uses sensors on the wrist to track hand movements and recognize hand washing actions. Both solutions have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on factors such as cost, accuracy, and ease of use. The camera-based solution may be more accurate but requires a fixed installation and may be more expensive, while the wearable device solution is portable and less expensive but may have lower accuracy. Ultimately, the best solution will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the user."
11,"The solution presented is a hand wash recognition system developed in Latvia. It uses a camera and machine learning algorithms to detect when someone is washing their hands and records the duration of the hand washing. This data can then be used to monitor and improve hand hygiene practices. The system also has the potential to be integrated with other technologies, such as automatic soap dispensers, to further promote proper hand hygiene."

Page 12 discusses the importance of using proper hand hygiene techniques to prevent the spread of infections and diseases. It emphasizes the five key moments for hand hygiene: before touching a patient, before clean/aseptic procedures, after body fluid exposure/risk, after touching a patient, and after touching patient surroundings. The proper technique for handwashing is also outlined, including using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub, rubbing hands together for at least 20 seconds, and drying hands with a clean towel or air dryer. It is important to perform hand hygiene correctly and consistently to protect both patients and healthcare workers."
13,"The Fujitsu hand wash recognition solution utilizes a camera and artificial intelligence technology to detect and track hand washing movements. It can accurately recognize hand washing actions and provide real-time feedback to users, such as a timer or audio prompts. This solution can be implemented in various settings, including hospitals and public facilities, to promote proper hand hygiene and prevent the spread of infections. It also has the potential to be integrated with other systems, such as access control and attendance tracking, for a more comprehensive approach to promoting hand washing."
14,"The video and accompanying article discuss Fujitsu's new AI technology, called ""Actlyzer,"" which is designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of data analysis in the manufacturing industry.
