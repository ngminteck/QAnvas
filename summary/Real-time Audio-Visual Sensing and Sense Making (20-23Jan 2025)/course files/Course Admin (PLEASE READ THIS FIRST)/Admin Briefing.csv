3,"The current public announcement system at NUS-ISS for emergency situations is a two-stage approach. Upon the trigger of the fire alarm, there will be two messages played. The first message will inform occupants that the fire alarm has been activated and that the situation is being investigated. The second message will inform occupants if the situation is a false alarm or if there is a need for evacuation. In the event of an evacuation, occupants are instructed to use the nearest exit staircase and follow the instructions of the Fire Wardens. Lifts should not be used."

These staircases are designated as primary and secondary evacuation routes in case of emergency. Each staircase has its own specific purpose and location within the building, and all are equipped with emergency lighting and signage. It is important for administrators to familiarize themselves and their staff with these evacuation routes in order to ensure a safe and efficient evacuation in case of emergency."
