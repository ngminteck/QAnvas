1,"The case study discusses the use of a real-time audio and video streaming system (RTAVS) for snore detection. The system uses a microphone and camera to capture audio and video data, which is then processed and analyzed in real-time. The goal is to accurately detect snoring sounds and provide feedback to the user. The system uses a combination of signal processing techniques, such as filtering and spectral analysis, to identify and differentiate snoring sounds from other noises. The results show that the RTAVS can successfully detect snoring with high accuracy, making it a useful tool for monitoring and improving sleep quality."
2,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder characterized by frequent collapse of the upper airway during sleep. Snoring is a common symptom, occurring in 70% to 95% of OSA patients. The gold standard for diagnosing OSA is polysomnography, which involves overnight recordings with multiple sensors in a sleep lab. However, this method is expensive, has long waiting lists, and can be uncomfortable due to the multiple sensors attached to the body."
3,"The team's goal is to use audio for OSA diagnosis, but first they need an algorithm to identify snoring events in audio recordings of 40 subjects, each over an hour long. The audio was recorded at 48kHz with a 24-bit resolution. Out of the 40 subjects, 32 had OSA and the others did not. The majority were male and the average age was 55."
4,"The exercise on day 4 of the RTAVS course asks participants to build an algorithm for detecting snoring in audio. This involves preparing a dataset, choosing a method, and specifying the input and output of the model. Participants are required to submit their answer in a Word document on Canvas, using a recording of 20 seconds with 7 snoring events, where the snoring events are colored in red on the waveform."
