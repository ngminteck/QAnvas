The fifth topic of the day focused on emerging advanced speech processing techniques. These techniques include deep learning, which uses neural networks to improve speech recognition accuracy, and end-to-end speech recognition, which eliminates the need for intermediate steps in the recognition process. Other techniques discussed were speaker diarization, which separates multiple speakers in a conversation, and speech enhancement, which improves the quality of speech in noisy environments. The speakers also highlighted the importance of data collection and the challenges of implementing these techniques in real-world applications."
3,"This section discusses the role of speech foundation models in speech recognition systems. These models are used to represent the acoustic properties of speech signals and aid in the recognition process. The most commonly used models are Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). HMMs are based on the assumption that speech signals can be divided into small segments with distinct acoustic properties, while DNNs use multiple layers of neural networks to capture complex acoustic patterns. Both models have their strengths and weaknesses, and researchers are constantly exploring ways to improve them for better speech recognition performance."
4,"The document discusses different types of learning in the context of accelerating digital excellence. Supervised learning requires human labeled data, which can be costly and time-consuming to build. Unsupervised learning does not require human labels and is easier to build databases with. Semi-supervised learning uses a small amount of labeled data, while self-supervised learning uses information from the input data to learn representations."
5,"The National University of Singapore SSL Framework for accelerating digital excellence involves two stages. The first stage utilizes self-supervised learning (SSL) to pre-train an upstream model. In the second stage, the downstream task uses the learned representation from the pre-trained model, which can be either frozen or fine-tuned using supervised data. This framework aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of digital learning and development."
6,"Wav2Vec 2.0 is a self-supervised learning method for training speech representation.
