Page 10, Humans have developed highly sophisticated skills for sensing their environment and taking actions according to what they observe . We are often influenced by the knowledge of how patterns are modeled and recognized in nature when we develop pattern recognition algorithms .
Page 11, The system forms clusters or natural groupings of the input patterns . No desired category is given but the teacher provides feedback to the system such as the decision is right or wrong .
