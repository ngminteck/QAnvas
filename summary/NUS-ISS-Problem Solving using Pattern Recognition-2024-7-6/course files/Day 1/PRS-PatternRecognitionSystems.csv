1,"The PRS-PatternRecognitionSystems.pdf document discusses the Graduate Certificate in Pattern Recognition Systems (PRS) and the Master of Technology in Artificial Intelligence Systems (AIS) offered by the National University of Singapore. These programs are designed to provide students with a strong foundation in pattern recognition and artificial intelligence systems. The PRS program is a shorter, focused program for those interested in a specific area of study, while the AIS program is a more comprehensive program for those looking to develop a broader understanding of artificial intelligence systems. Both programs are designed to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in the field of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence."
2,"The National University of Singapore offers a Graduate Certificate in Pattern Recognition Systems, consisting of three courses: Problem Solving using Pattern Recognition (5 days), Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Systems (5 days), and Intelligent Sensing and Sense Making (4 days). These courses focus on developing skills in problem-solving, machine learning, and intelligent sensing within the context of pattern recognition."
3,"The document outlines the assessment structure for the Certificate Level course in Pattern Recognition Systems at the National University of Singapore. The final written exam is worth 50% of the grade and covers three courses: PSUPR, PRMLS, and ISSM. The remaining 50% is determined by a practice module project and in-class assessments, including compulsory quizzes and workshops for all three courses."
