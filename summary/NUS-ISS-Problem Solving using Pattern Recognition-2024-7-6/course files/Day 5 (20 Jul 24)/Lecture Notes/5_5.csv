2,"D convolution is a mathematical operation commonly used in image processing and deep learning. It involves a kernel, which is a small matrix of numbers, being applied to a larger input matrix. The kernel is slid over the input matrix, and at each position, the values of the kernel are multiplied with the corresponding values in the input matrix and summed. This process results in a new matrix, known as the feature map, which highlights important features in the input.

The concept of max pooling is introduced in this document, which is a technique used in convolutional neural networks. Max pooling involves dividing the input image into smaller sections and taking the maximum value from each section, creating a smaller output image with reduced dimensions. This helps to reduce the number of parameters and computation required in the network, while also providing some translation invariance. Max pooling is often used after convolutional layers in order to extract the most important features from the input image."

Max pooling is a technique used to reduce the spatial size of the input in CNNs, which helps to decrease the number of parameters and computation needed.

The source cited in the document provides a detailed explanation of the implementation of max pooling in CNNs."
