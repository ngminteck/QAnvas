The article discusses a study conducted by LawGeex, a legal tech company, which compared the accuracy of human lawyers and AI in reviewing non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). The study involved 20 experienced lawyers from companies such as Goldman Sachs and Cisco. The results showed that the AI technology used by LawGeex achieved a 94% accuracy rate in identifying potential risks in NDAs, while human lawyers only achieved an 85% accuracy rate. This highlights the potential for AI to assist and improve the efficiency of contract review processes."
6,"The article discusses the results of a study comparing the time it took for lawyers and AI to review 5 NDAs. The lawyers took an average of 92 minutes, while the AI only took 26 seconds. The AI also had a higher accuracy rate of 94%, compared to the lawyers' 85%. This highlights the potential for AI to be more efficient and accurate in reviewing legal documents."
7,"The website http://claudette.eui.eu/tools/index.html is a useful tool for identifying unfair clauses in contracts. It is designed by Claudette, a project at the National University of Singapore, and can be used to spot potentially problematic clauses."
